You Got The Silver
Rolling Stones
 
 
  Bb        F7  Bb
  Hey babe,    what's in your eyes
F7               Bb                 F7
  I saw them flashing like airplane lights
  Bb                    F7
  You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
                  Bb                     Bb  Bbdim  F7
  But I must come back for a little more
 
  Bb  Fdim
 
F7           Bb                F7
  You got my heart, you got my soul
              Bb                 F7
  You got the silver, you got the gold
              Bb                F7
  You got the diamonds from the mines
                Bb                   Cm7   Ab/C  Cm/F
  And that's allright it'll buy some time
 
 
F7        Bb    F7            Bb
  Tell me honey   what will I do
F7        Bb                 F7
  When I am hungry and thirsty too
          Bb                      F7
  Feeling fooling, and that's for sure
               Bb
  Just waiting here at your kitchen door
 
  Bb  Bdim  F7 |  Bb  F7 Bb7
 
      Eb                   Bb
  Hey baby, what's in your eyes
              Eb                Bb
  Is that the diamonds from the mines
              Eb               Bb
  What's that laughing in your smile
          Eb        Edim         F7
  I don't care, no,      I don't care
 
 
F7    Bb
  Oh, baby, you got the soul
              Eb                  Bb
  You got the silver, you got the gold
             Eb                Bb
  A flash of love just made me blind
          Eb      Edim                          F7
  I don't care, no        that's no big surprise
