                                As Tears go by 
                              The Rolling Stones

                
        Verse 1 F         G                  B      C
                It is the evening  of  the   day
                F         G                  B      C
                I sit and watch the children play
                B             C7
                smiling faces I can see 
                F           Dm
                But not for me 
                B                           C       C7
                I sit and watch as tears go by

        
           ( And the rest goes with the same chords)
        
        Verse 2              
                My ritches can't buy everything
                I want to hear the children sing
                All I hear is the sound
                Of rain falling on the ground,
                I sit and watch as tears go by.
        
        Verse 3
                It is the evening of the day
                I sit and watch the children play
                Doing things I used to do
                They think on you
                I sit and watch as tears go by.
