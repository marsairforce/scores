Love In Vain
The Rolling Stones
 
        Bb                         Bb7
Well, I followed her to the station    with a suitcase in my hand,
        Eb                         F7                             Bb  F7  Bb
yeah, I followed her to the station    with a suitcase in my hand.
           F7                              F/A   Gm           Eb        Bb
Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell,      but all true love's in vain
                                   Bb7
When the train come in the station I looked her in the eye,
          Eb                        F7                            Bb  F7/A  Bb
well, the train come in the station   and I looked her in the eye.
        F7                       Gm               Eb       Bb
Well, I felt so sad and lonesome that I could not help but cry.
                                 Bb7
When the train left the station, it had two lights on behind,
               Eb                      F                      Bb    F  Bb
yeah, when the train left the station, it had two lights on behind.
          F7                      Gm                Eb     Bb    Bb7  F
Well, the blue light was my baby, and the red light was my mind.
Bb7                     Eb  F7  Bb7  F7  Bb7
All my love's in vain.
F7   Gm     Eb        Bb     Bb7  Bb
All, all my love's in vain.
