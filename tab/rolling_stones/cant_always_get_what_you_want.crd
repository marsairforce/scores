Here's the gist/chords of Can't Always Get What You Want 
by the Rolling Stones...

(Please note I make NO guarantees about the words, I'm doing this on the fly,
but it should be enough to get you started.  Besides, I don't I ever really
knew the words :o )

It's best to listen to a recording to get the strumming pattern...


(In the key of C)


C                           F 
   I saw her today at the reception
C                         F
   A glass of wine in her hand
C                                   F 
   I knew she was going to meet her connection
C                              F                   
   At her feet was a footloose man

Chorus:

C                                  F
(No) you can't always get what you want

C                             F
You can't always get what you want

D
But if you try sometime, 

F
you might find

                 C                      F                    etc...
You get what you need...                yeah, yeah.....


BTW, If you are still at the point where an F chord if gruesome, then go ahead
and just play in the key of D (play D instead of C, G instead of F, and E 
instead of D in the chorus).  I did it that way when I was first learning the
guitar.

Hope this works and sorry for any mistakes or misjudgements.

The tab for this would be really cool as the song really isn't strummmed...
...anyone?
