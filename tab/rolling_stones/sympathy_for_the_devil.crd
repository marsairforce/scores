I'm not too sure about the Dmaj7 chord the book prescribes,
though it's pretty close.
Enjoy,

The Rolling Stones
 
         Am             Dmaj7
Please allow me to introduce myself,
      Am                E7
I'm a man of wealth and taste.
Am                          Dmaj7
I've been around for many a long, long years,
     Am                           E7
I've stolen many a man's soul and faith.
Am                  Dmaj7              Am                   E7
I was around when Jesus Christ had his moments of doubt and pain.
                        Dmaj7           Am                   E7
I made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate.
 
B7                                     E
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name.
           B7                                E
But what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game
 
 
                   D
I stuck around St. Petersburg,
       Am                        E
when I saw it was time for a change.
                          D
I killed the tzar and his ministers,
    Am                E
Anastasia screamed in vain.
                          D
I rode a tank, held a general's rank,
              C#m         A       E
when the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank.
 
 
B7                                     E
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name.
            B7                                 E
But what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game.
 
 
               Am              Dm
I watched with glee while your kings and queens,
               Am                        E7
fought for ten decades for the gods they made.
Am                             Dm
I shouted out, 'who killed the Kennedy's?'
     Am                       E7
when after all it was you and me.
 
 
So let me please introduce myself,
I'm a man of wealth and taste,
and I lay traps for troubadours,
who get killed before they reach Bombay.
 
 
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game.
 
E                      D
Just as every cop is a criminal,
    C#m                     E
and all the sinners, saints.
                                D
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer,
              C#m
'cause I'm in need of some restraint.
                             D
So if you meet me, have some courtesy,
          C#m               E
have some sympathy and some taste.
                          D
Use all your well-learned politess,
        C#m              E
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
 
 
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
but what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game.
