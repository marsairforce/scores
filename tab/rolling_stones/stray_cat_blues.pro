Credits go to those who contributed to the lyrics. Any blame for
mistakes in the chords or tabs go to me (I still don't have my guitar
beside my workstation). It should be something in this vein, though.

{title: Stray Cat Blues }
{subtitle:The Rolling Stones }
{c: thanks to David Boucher, Bob Paley, Scott Hannon }

{c: Intro: }

[A7]            [A7]
[D]     [C]     [G]     [G]    [F]

[D]I hear the [C]click-clack of your feet on the [G]stairs [G]    [F]
[D]I know you're [C]no scare-eyed [G]honey. [G]    [F]
{c: "Scare-eyed" should be "teary-eyed" }
[D]There'll be a [C]feast if you just [G]come upstairs [G]    [F]
[A]But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

I can see that you're fifteen years old
No I don't want your I.D.
And I can see that you're so far from home
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

[C]Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don'tcha scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
bet you mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know that you spit like that.

You look so wierd and you're so far from home
But you don't really miss your mother
Don't look so scared I'm not no mad-brained bear
But it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don'tcha scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
bet you mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know that you spit like that.

{c: The last 2 lines of the chorus are different every time.  It's }
{c: "I bet your mama didn't know you can spread like that" in one verse, }
{c: and "I bet she didn't know you could bite like that" in another. }

You say you got a friend she's wilder than you
Well, why don't you bring her upstairs
If she's so wild she can join in too

Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don'tcha scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
bet you mama don't know you scream like that

I bet your mother don't know that you bite like that

{c: The above line goes earlier, not here. }

I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back
