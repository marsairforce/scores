The original version of this is 3 guitars.

Acoustic 1 ("Nashville tuning"- low 3 strings an octave up)
   this is the one which starts the song off, there are no bass
   strings which gives it that high sound.  After the intro it
   mainly plays harmonics

Acoustic 2 (Open G- D G D G B D)
   this is the main acoustic throughout the song.  If I get some
   requests I will put this part down.

Electric 3 (Standard tuning)
   this is Mick Taylor's classic backing and superb solo.  If I get
   _lots_ of requests I might summon the energy to tab the solo, if
   I get hundreds I might even tab the whole part.

For now, I will just do CRD.  Despite having 3 guitars on the original
recording, this one sounds surprisingly full with just 1 acoustic
(standard tuning) and voice.

Intro:
   G  Am7  G  Gsus  Am7  G


   Bm         G   Gsus  Bm           G   Gsus
1.  Childhood living      is easy to do
   Am          G   C      D  G   Gsus        G     D  Dsus2  D  C
    The things you wanted    I   brought them  for you
   Bm         G    Gsus   Bm              G  Gsus
    Graceless lady         you know who I am
   Am          G     C       D  G  Gsus         G  D Dsus2 D
    You know I can't let you      slide through my hands

   Am     G  C      D  G         F       G  C     Bm
Ch. Wild     horses     couldn't drag me a- way
   Am        G  C      D G         F       G  C
    Wild wild   horses    couldn't drag me a- way

2.  I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
    Now you've decided to show me the same
    No sweeping exits or off-stage lines
    Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Ch. Wild horses couldn't drag me away
                                       C(VIII)
    Wild wild horses couldn't drag me away

    [guitar break]
    Fsus2(VIII) C(VIII) x 3
    D G


3.  I know I've dreamed you a sin and a lie
    I have my freedom but I don't have much time
    Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
    Let's do some living, after we'll die

Ch. Wild horses couldn't drag me away
    Wild wild horses we'll ride them some day.
