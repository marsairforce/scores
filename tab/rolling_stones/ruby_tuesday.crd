                Ruby Tuesday
 
Bm          A       G       A7             D
She would never say   where she came from
Bm       A       G     A
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
Bm7       E7           A
While the sun is bright
   Bm7    E7            A7
Or in the darkest night
             D                    A
No one knows    she comes and goes
 
 
chorus:
D   A7   D
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
          A7         D
Who could hang a name on you
          A7          D7      G
When you change with every new day
A7                   D     Asus
Still I'm gonna miss you
 
bridge: Asus///Bm/A/G/A7/Dsus/D/
 
 
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She justcan't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost    at such a cost
 
chorus:
 
There's no time to lose I heard her say
Cash your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind   ain't life unkind
 
chorus:
 
Enjoy,
Hans
