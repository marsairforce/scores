 Salt of the Earth by Jagger and Richards
 -----------------
 (keith sings four lines)
 E    B             E           A E (repeat)
 lets drink to the hard working people
 lets drink to the lowly of birth
 raise your glass to the good and the evil
 lets drink to the salt of the earth
 (mick sings the rest)

 a choice of cancer or polio
 
 and when i...
 
 lets drink to the hard working people
 lets think of the lowly of birth
 spare a thought for the rag taggy people
 lets drink to the salt of the earth
 
 lets drink to the hard working people
 lets drink to the salt of the earth
 lets think of the two thousand million
 lets think of the humble of birth
