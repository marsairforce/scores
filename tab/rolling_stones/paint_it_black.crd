Paint It Black
The Rolling Stones
 
 
verse 1
Fm                     C7
I see a red door and I want it painted black
Fm                   C7                       Fm
No colours anymore I want them to turn black
  Eb      Ab                    Fm
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
  Eb      Ab         Eb  Bb
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
 
verse 2
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day
 
verse 3
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and I want it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
 
verse 4 and end
Fm                           C7
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
Fm                             C7                Fm
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
   Eb     Ab       Eb   Fm
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
   Eb        Ab         Eb   Bb                   C7
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
                 Fm                  C7
I wanna see your face painted black, black as night
      Fm                       C7
Don't wanna see the sun flying high in the sky
               Fm                                    C7   Fm
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black,  yeah
