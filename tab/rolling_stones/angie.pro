[Am]Angie, [E]Angie
[F]When will those [G]clouds all disap[C]pear?
[Am]Angie, [E]Angie
[F]Where were the [G]ladies from [C]here?
With no [G]loving in our souls
and no [Dm]money in our [Am]coats
[C]You can't [F]say we're satisf[G]ied 
[Am]Angie, [E]Angie
[F]You can't [G]say we never [C]tried 
[Am]Angie, you're [E]beautiful...yes
[F]but ain't it [G]time we said good[C]bye
[Am]Angie, I still [E]love you
[F]Remember [G]all those nights we [C]cried
All the [G]dreams we held so close
Seem to [Dm]all go up in [Am]smoke
[C]Oh let me [F]whisper in your [G]ear 
[Am]Angie, [E]Angie       
[F]Where were the [G]ladies from [C]here?
{c: piano solo }
Oh [G]Angie don't you weep
All your [Dm]kisses still taste [Am]sweet
[C]I hate that [F]sadness in your [G]eyes
but [Am]Angie, [E]Angie
[F]Ain't it [G]time we said good[C]bye...ya
{c: strings }
With no [G]loving in our souls
and no [Dm]money in our [Am]coats
[C]Oh you can't [F]say we're satis[G]fied 
but [Am]Angie, I still love you [E]baby
[F]Every where I [G]look I see your [C]eyes
[Am]There ain't a woman that comes [E]close to you
[F]Come on [G]baby dry your [C]eyes
[Am]Angie, [E]Angie
[F]Ain't it [G]good to be a[C]live
[Am]Angie, [E]Angie
[F]They can't [G]say we never [F]tr[E]ie[Dm]d   [C]
