|Up and down the road in our |worn out shoes

For the D7 he's using both xx0212 and xx7575  (EADGBE)
For the E7, I'm not sure, but probably the x7675x.

               Life By The Drop
              (Stevie Ray Vaughn)

intro: adlib in A

A            E
Hello there, my old friend
F#m                      D
Not so long ago it was 'til the end
A                      E
We played outside in th' pouring rain
F#m                      D
On our way up the road we started over again

F#m                      D          E
You're livin' our dream, wo you on top
F#m                  D              E
My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop
F#m             D7            E             A
That's how it happens livin' life by th' drop

A                         E
Up and down that road in our worn out shoes
F#m                         D
Talkin' 'bout good thangs, singin' th' blues
A                  E
You went your way, I stayed behind
F#m                          D7
We both knew it was just a matter of time

F#m                      D          E
You're livin' our dream, wo you on top
F#m                 D             E
My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop
F#m             D7             E           A
That's how it happens livin' life by th' drop
     
A                 E
No wasted time, we're alive today
F#m                               D       (D7)
Churnin' up th' past, there's no easier way
A                     E
Time's between us, a means to an end
F#m                                  D7
God it's good to to be here walkin' together my friend

F#m                      D          E
We livin' our dreams,
F#m                      D          E
My mind's stopped achin'
F#m              D7           E             A
That's how it happens livin' life by th' drop  .. repeat
