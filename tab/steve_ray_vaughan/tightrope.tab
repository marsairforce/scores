Here are some of my comments in order to improve tab that I found
at nevada. I'd like to thank Chuck Dolese for contributing Tightrope-SRV
to the net. Please take time to improve this if you know the song..
My comments are labelled with "UJD" at the end...

The intro seems to be arpeggios off the chords...like
E D B & A G E. This is'nt reflected in the tab above though...UJD.

   B9         E9     A     G

Are A and G parts of the verse??  It seems to me the chords to the
verses were B9 (As above)  G#m E9  and the intro stuff following that. I've
written this against the lyrics I got from nevada.----UJD



B9
Caught up in a world wind cant catch my breath, knee deep in hot water

broke out in cold sweat, cant catch the turtle in this rat race feels like
     G#m7     E9                  E-D-B7  A-G-E
I'm losing time at breakneck pace.



The chorus is quite correct...(As Chuck Dolese wrote below..) except the A and
G below should (IMHO) be replaced by A and E9(?)......UJD.


                      E9                          B9
  People walking the tightrope trying to make it right
  E9                                             B9
  Walking the tightrope  every day and every night etc...repeat order of chord
               E9                            B9
  Walking the tightrope
               A       G    (intro)



 Solo is played in the key of B
yes --UJD



PLEASE COMMENT ON THESE ...(all you good for nothing SRV fans)
