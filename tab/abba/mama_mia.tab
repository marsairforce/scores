Verse 1:

D         A          D           A          G
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when.

D    A          D            A          G
So I made up my mind it must come to an end.

 
D   (lick #1)  Dmin#5 
Look at me now,  will I ever learn?

D (lick #2)  Dmin#5               G
I don't know   how but I suddenly lose control.

               A
There's a fire within my soul.

G    D   A
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring,

G   D    A                           
One more look and I forget everything, oooh.


Chorus:

D
Mama mia, here I go again.

C  G             D
My my, how can I resist you?

D
Mama mia, does it show again?

C  G                      D
My my, just how much I've missed you.

D (Lick #3)    A
Yes, I've been brokenhearted.

Bmin           F#min
Blue since the day we parted.

C   G   Emin       A
Why why did I ever let you go.

D (Lick #4) Bmin
Mama mia,    now I really know,

C  G   Emin          A
My my, I could never let you go.


Verse 2:
I've been angry and sad about the things that you do.
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through.
And when you go, when you slam the door,
I think you know that you won't be away too long,
You know that I'm not that strong.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring,
One more look and I forget everything, oooh.

Mama mia, here I go again.
My my, how can I resist you?
Mama mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you.
Yes, I've been brokenhearted,
blue since the day we parted.
Why, why did I ever let you go.
Mama mia, even if I say
bye bye, leave me now or never,
Mama mia, it's a game we play.
Bye bye doesn't mean forever.

Mama mia, here I go again.
My my, how can I resist you?
Mama mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you.
Yes, I've been brokenhearted,
blue since the day we parted.
Why, why did I ever let you go.
Mama mia, now I really know,
my my, I could never let you go.
