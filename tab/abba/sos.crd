Verse 1:

Dmin                  A7                           Dmin
Where are those happy times - they seem so hard to find.

Dmin               A7                           Dmin
I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind.

F                 C   
Whatever happened to our love ?

Gmin          Dmin  
I wish I understood.

Dmin             A7                     Dmin
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good.


Chorus:

F              C        Gmin              Bb       F/Fsus4/F/Fsus4
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, SOS

F            C        Gmin             Bb       F/Fsus4/F/Fsus4 
The love you gave me, nothing less can save me, SOS


Bb                        Db     Eb        F
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on ?

Bb                         Db          Eb      F
When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on ?


Verse 2:

You seem so far away though you are standing near.
You make me feel alive but something died, I fear.
I really tried to make it up - I wish I understood.
What happened to our love, it used to be so good.
