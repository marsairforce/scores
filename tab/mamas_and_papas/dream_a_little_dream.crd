I saw a request for this song.  Here's my version.

	I like older jazz tunes for acoustic guitar and vocal, especially
if you play jazzy-sounding chords.  Here's how I play Dream a Little Dream.
(BTW: does anyone know how old this song is and who wrote it?  I would
expect it to be from the 40s.)  This song is cool because, although there
are several chords, most of them can be played by learning a few positions
and simply moving the position up and down the fingerboard.  As with all
the stuff I post, chord names are not guaranteed (certainly the ?? chords),
but if you play the patterns that I've given below for each chord name in
the song, it should work for you.  As usual, numbers are fingers, x means
mute the string.

Dream a Little Dream

G6    Em7            Am7      D9
Stars shining bright above you
G6    F#6     F6      E9        E9/B
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you
Am7                  Eb9      Eb9/Bb
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
G6             Eb9      D9
Dream a little dream of me
G6  Em7              Am7    D9
Say nighty-night and kiss me
G6   F#6     F6        E9             E9/B
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
Am7                 Eb9         Eb9/Bb
While I'm alone and blue as can be
G6             Eb9   D9 G6
Dream a little dream of me

Chorus
G6    Em7         Am7        D9  
Stars fading, but I linger on dear
G6    Em7          Am7    D9
Still craving your kiss
G6  Em7        Am7         D9
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
G6          Eb??  Eb9  D9
Just saying this

G6    Em7                  Am7       D9
Sweet dreams till sun beams find you
G6    F#6         F6         E9
Sweet dreams that leave your worries behind you
Am7                    Eb9
But in your dreams whatever they be
G6             Eb9   D9 G6
Dream a little dream of me

I put an Eb9-to-d9 change in the transcript above, but I actually prefer an
Eb7 to D7 change.  I'm tired of typing out chord transcriptions, though, so
if you don't know those positions and would like me to send them to you,
send me email.

I'd be interested in any other chords folks know to this song.

... and here's a version I picked up from the net some time ago.  I think,

more accurate.  I also have a couple of comments about your chord diagrams
below...

    This is a G major chord.  It does not have the 6th degree of the G major
scale to make it a G6.  To add it, press with your pinky the B string on the
5th fret and mute the D string it was playing:
EADGBE
11x111 <- 3rd fret

      This is an Eb#9.  The 9th degree is on the B string played with the
4th finger (the pinky).  If the B string was played on the 6th fret instead
of the seventh, the chord would be an Eb9, the same as you described  in
your post.


Dream on...  :-)
