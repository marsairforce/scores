   REM: OUT OF TIME

   RADIO SONG

Hey, I can't find nothing on the radio
Yo! turn to that station

Intro riff:

E-----11-------11-------11-------11-----
B---13--13---13--13---14--14---14--14---
G-13-------13-------13-------13---------


{play intro riff}:
The world is collapsing around our ears
I turned up the radio, but I can't hear it.

       F7
When I got to the house and I called you out
        F7
I could tell that you had been crying, crying.
          F7
It's that same sing song on the radio.  It makes me sad.
  Bbsus2        Bb7sus2  Bbsus2     Bb7sus2  Bbsus2  Bb7sus2 Bbsus2
I meant to turn it off,          to say good-bye, to leave in quiet
Bb7sus2    Bbsus2    F7
that radio        song, hey, hey, hey

{play intro riff}
I've everything to show.  I've everything to hide.  Look into my eyes.  Listen.


| Bb5  |  Eb5 |


       F7                                 F7
When I got to the show (yo ho ho) I could tell that you had been crying, crying
          F7                                    F7
It's that same sing song, and the DJ sucks.  It makes me sad.
  Bbsus2        Bb7sus2  Bbsus2     Bb7sus2  Bbsus2  Bb7sus2 Bbsus2
I tried to turn it off.          To say  goodbye,    my     love,
Bb7sus2    Bbsus2    F7
that radio        song, hey, hey, hey


{play intro riff}
The world is collapsing around our ears
I turned up the radio, But I can't hear it.


| Bb5  |  Eb5 |


      F7
Yeah!    (baby, baby, baby, baby)
  Bbsus2        Bb7sus2  Bbsus2     Bb7sus2  Bbsus2          Bb7sus2   Bbsus2
I tried to sing along.                         But, damn that    radio song.
Bb7sus2   Bbsus2    F7            F7
Hey, hey, hey,          hey, hey, hey.


{play intro riff}
I've everything to show
I've everything to hide
Look into my eyes listen to the radio
I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it
No, I can't hear it


| Bb5  |  Eb5 |

            F7
Hey, hey, hey (say what)
Hey, hey, hey (let me do that with you)
Hey, hey, hey, hey ,hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, (say what, say what, say what)
Hey, hey, hey

F7
Check it out
What are you saying
What are you playing
Who are you obeying
day out day in?
Baby baby baby
That stuff is driving me crazy
DJs communicate to the masses
Sex and violent classes
Now our children grow up prisoners
All their lives radio listeners

        Am            Em
Oh life    is bigger,    it's bigger than you.
            Am                              Em
And you are not me, the lengths that I will go to.
                           Am
The distance in your eyes.
Em                  Em(II) Ebm Dm                      G
   Oh no, I've said     too    much, I've said enough.
                         Am                  Em
That's me in the corner,    That's me in the spot light,
                    Am           Em
Losing my religion.    Trying to keep up with you.
      Am
And I don't know if I can do it.
Em                  Em(II) Ebm Dm                           G
   Oh no, I've said     too    much, I haven't said enough.
                                     F Fsus2
I thought that I heard you laughing.

I thought that I heard you sing.
  F          Fsus2  F   G   Am

  Every whisper,
             Em                                 Am
Every waking hour, I'm choosing my confessions.
          Em
Trying to keep eye on you.
       Am
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool.
Em                            Dm                G
   Oh no, I've said too much.    I said enough.
               Am               Em
Consider this,    consider this hint of the century.
               Am                Em
Consider this,    the slip, that brought me to my knees pale.
Am                               Em
What if all these fantasies come    flaming aground.
Em(II)   Dm       G
Now I've said too much.
                                     F Fsus2
I thought that I heard you laughing.
F                G         Am    Am(II)

| A5  G5 | B5 | A5 G5 | B5 | A5 G5 | B5 |

A5         G5   B5   A5        G5     B5
Dusk is dawn is day,     where did it go?
A5   G5        B5       A5   G5       B5
     I've been laughing      fast and slow.
A5           G5         B5     A5      G5     B5
   Moving in    a still frame, howling at the moon.
A5           G5     B5       A5 G5     B5
   Morning found me laughing    up and down, down.

A5   G5    B5
Low, low, low.
A5       G5       B5        A5      G5       B5
   Night suits me fine, and morning suits me fine.
A5         G5    B5           A5 G5     B5          A5 G5    B5      A5
   I've been so happy, happy,    way up high, high,    in between,
G5     B5    A5   G5    B5
down below.  Low, low, low.


Cmaj7               G          E5
      I skipped the part about    love.
Cmaj7              G             E5
      It seemed so silly and low.

A5   G5    B5
Low, low, low.
A5   G5    B5
Low, low, low.

A5          G5       B5     A5        G5     B5
     I said    the morning,    it isn't your time.
A5   G5       B5     A5           G5      B5
     Barefoot naked,    I can see    your lines.
A5      G5      B5         A5      G5     B5
     It doesn't bother me,     if you are right.
     A5       G5                         A5        G5       B
Your grass is grassy wet.  Your light white is bright light white.  Light.

Cmaj7               G          E5
      I skipped the part about    love.
Cmaj7              G              E5
      It seemed so shallow and low.

A5   G5    B5
Low, low, low
A5   G5    B5
Low, low, low


A      G      B    A      G          B
      You and me,     we know about time.
A         G       B                A            G       B
      We know how things go.  They come and go;   they live and grow;
          A         G      B
They pass   and go,    and glow and glow.
A            G   B
Up and down,        high and low.

A    G     B
Low, low, low.
A    G     B
Low, low, low.

Cmaj7               G          E5
      I skipped the part about    love.
Cmaj7              G             E5
      It seemed so silly and low.
Cmaj7               G          E5
      I skipped the part about    love.
Cmaj7              G              E5
      It seemed so shallow and low.

A5   G5    B5
Low, low, low.
A5   G5    B5
Low, low, low.

A5      G5       B5    A5       G5    B5     A5       G5    B5
     I like your hands all full    of glory, all full    of glory.

G                         Gsus4
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning.
                    G5
She got up from the kitchen table,
                           G
folded the newspaper and silenced the radio.
G                           Gsus4                     G5                G

          G5                                       G
She began to breathe, to breathe at the thought of such freedom,

stood and whispered to her child, belong.
Gsus4                            G5                             G
She held the child and whispered with calm, calm; belong.

These barricades can only hold for so long.
                             G5
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning.
                           G
She took the child held tight, opened the window;
G                        Gsus4                       G5         G

{Db5 riff}
I sat there looking ugly, looking ugly and mean.
Knew what you were saying you were saying to me.
Baby's got some new rules, baby said she's had it with me.
It seems a shame you waste your time on me.
Seems a lie to waste your time for me.

{Ab5 riff}                              {Db5 riff}
Left me to love,  What it's doing to me.

{Db5 riff}
There's a lot of honey in this world, baby this honey's from me.
Got to do what you do, do it with me.
It seems a shame you waste your time for me.

{Ab5 riff}                              {Db5 riff}
Left me to love,  What it's doing to me.

{Db5 riff}
Knocked silly, knocked flat, sideways down.
These things they pick you up, turn you around.
Say your piece, say you're sweet for me.
It's all the same to share the pain with me.
It's all the same.  Save the shame for me.

{Ab5 riff}                              {Db5 riff}
Left me to love,  What it's doing to me.

{Db5 riff}
Baby's got some new rules, baby says she's had it with me.
There's a fly in the honey and baby's got a baby with me.
That's a part, that's a part of me.

{Ab5 riff}                              {Db5 riff}
Left me to love,  What it's doing to me.
{Ab5 riff}                              {Db5 riff}
Left me to love,  What it's doing to me.

{Db5 riff}        {Db5 riff}
What about me?    What about me?

Anytime something screeches across the room, and latches onto
someone's neck, and the guy screams, and tries to get it off,
I have to laugh, because what *is* that thing?
