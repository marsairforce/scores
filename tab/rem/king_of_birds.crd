Here's how I figured KOB.  The fills, which I didn't feel like trying to
transpose to guitar, or type the tab for, seem to be in D (major).

Someone posted the chords previously. I just wanted to make a suggestion 
about the D chord that's primarily used throughout the song.

Play it like this:
----5---
----3---
----2---
----0---
--------
--------
(An easy way to play it is barre the 2nd fret over the top 3 strings, use
your ring finger for the 3rd fret 5th string 'D' and then use your pinky
to stretch up to the 5th fret 'A'. Lifting the pinky gives you a quick D.)

And play around with it, like descending on that high E string (frets->5,3,2)
through one line of verse.  You'll hear it.

Also, I'm not so sure the 'G' chord given in the post is correct, I think
it might be a Bm, but I'll check.  I do appreciate the posting though.  I
knew I'd never get around to it...
