End on E chord (7th fret)

Notes:  There are two or three guitars on this song.  One basically drones on
E notes, played on three strings at once.  A 12 string would be ideal for this
part.  Another guitar plays the little riff on the B string.  I combined these
two parts as the main riff.  A third guitar plays the E chord on the seventh
fret (with open E and B strings) and the A chord during the "Time after Time"
section.  It sounds like there's more going on due to the interaction of these
parts.

Suggestions/corrections welcomed.  I transcribed this (and Pretty Persuasion)
in response to a recent request.  I'd love to see more early REM (from 1st two
albums) in tab form.

Time After Time (AnnElise), by REM, from Reckoning
transcribed by Phil Saunders and John Carroll

The tune is in E flat, but uses standard ÒEÓ chord shapes.

Play the main riff and chorus on a guitar tuned to F, or tuned normally and
capoed to the first fret, or tuned to E flat and capoed on the second fret.

Play the 2nd guitar part on a guitar tuned to E flat, so you can get the drone
effect.  You can just play the 1st and 2nd strings if you want.

Play the 3rd guitar part (ringing chords) on a guitar tuned to E flat, using
this shape:
Eb chord shape:  079900

Main riff (tune to F or capo 1st fret)
F--|-0----0-0-0---3-3-sl-5-0----  This is the main riff and repeats many
times
C--|-3----3-3-3---3-3--------0--  throughout the song.  I believe that the
main
Ab-|-2----2-2-2---2-2-----------  chord here is Dsus2 with some extra picking
Eb-|-0----0-0-0---0-0-----------  thrown in.  Wierd, but not so hard once you
get
Bb-|----------------------------  the hang of it.  Tune to F to maximize
ringing
F--|----------------------------  of open strings.  (Or play in standard
tuning
                                  with capo on 1st fret).

2nd guitar (tune to E flat)
Eb-|-0-0-0-0----0-0-0-0-----|  This is the droning heard through most of the
song
Bb-|-5-5-5-5----5-5-5-5-----|  Play with either two or three strings, your
choice.
Gb-|-9-9-9-9----------------|
Db-|------------------------|
Ab-|------------------------|
Eb-|------------------------|

Eb

End on Eb chord (7th fret)

Notes:  There are three guitars on this song.  One (tuned to F?) plays the
main riff.  The second basically drones on Eb notes, played on two strings at
once.  A 12 string would be ideal for this part.  A third guitar plays the Eb
chord on the seventh fret (with open Eb and Bb strings).  It sounds like
there's more going on due to the interaction of these parts.

Suggestions/corrections welcomed.  I transcribed this in response to John
CarrollÕs recent request.  John took my original effort and figured out a
better way to play the main riff, which is so much simpler it must be correct.
 I incorporated his changes in this version and have also rewritten it so that
the chords reflect the true pitches, since I believe there are two different
guitar tunings on this song (both E flat and F)

Here's an easier way to play the main riff to Time After Time.  I also think
that the chorus is actually Fm (F minor) and Ab rather than 2 measures
of Ab.  I've transcribed this in the key of D, but the key on the album (Eb)
can be achieved by placing a capo on the first fret.  

Thanks to Phil Saunders for the hints to get me started.

E-0----0-0-0---3-3-sl-5-0----  This is the main riff and repeats many times
B-3----3-3-3---3-3--------0--  throughout the song.  I believe that the main
G-2----2-2-2---2-2-----------  chord here is Dsus2 with some extra picking
D-0----0-0-0---0-0-----------  thrown in.  Wierd, but not so hard once you get
A----------------------------  the hang of it.  Played w/capo on 1st fret
E----------------------------  sounds like the album.

The "time after time after time" part is, without the capo, Em and G (or Fm and
Ab with the capo).  Probably something like this:

  Em -------> G-------->
E-----0-----------3------  This is the chorus.
B-------0---0---0--0---0-
G---0-----0---0------0---
D-2----------------------
A------------------------
E------------------------

I don't claim that this is exactly right, but is easier (for me anyway) to play.

John

	I posted a riff for this song a while back, and the somebody corrected
it.  Well, yesteday, while watching an old Rockumetary, they showed probably 
20 seconds of P.B. playing it, and needless to say, I was right.  The guitar,
just like I had said originally, is not tuned to A 440.  It's more or less
a half step sharp (I can't remember which right now, more or less than a half
step).  But anyway, it's played something very like this:

                   H  S
E-2--x--x--2--2--2--3--5--0---------------------------------------
B-3--x--x--3--3--3-----5--0---------------------------------------
G-2--x--x--2--2-(2)(0)(0)(0)--------------------------------------
D-0--x--x--0--0-(0)(0)(0)(0)--------------------------------------
A-----------------------------------------------------------------
E-----------------------------------------------------------------
  
	Sometimes it just ends on that E thing, but sometimes you might
also want to slide back down to the G thing, and then pull off to E very
quickly.

E thing	= -0-
	  -0-
	  (0)
	  (0)
	  ---
	  --- 

G thing = -3-
	  -3-
	  (0)
	  (0)
	  ---
	  ---


	 Plus, it's not clear in the footage if this is happening or not,
so the question's still open, but a friend of mine without Internet access
claims that the thing at the fifth fret is actually:

	-5-
	-5-
	(4)
	(0)
	---
	---


	I don't find that it makes all that much difference when I play it,
because I tend to upstroke those notes, and that B doesn't ring much.
Whatever.
