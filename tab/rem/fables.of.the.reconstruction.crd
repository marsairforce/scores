   REM: FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCTION

   FEELING GRAVITY'S PULL


{opening riff}

#har denotes harmonics on that fret
(E)---7--------7--------0--------------------------5har--
(B)-----7--------7----0---0----------7har----------5har--
(G)-------10-------10----------------7har----------5har--
(D)----------------------------------7har----------5har--
(A)-------------------------9-9999-9-7har-9-9999-9-------
(E)-------------------------7-7777-7------7-7777-7-------

  {play the riff but start with the stuff on the 7th fret of
   the low E string}

I fell asleep and read just about every paragraph.

Read the scene where gravity is pulling me around
Peel back the mountains peel back the sky
Stomp gravity into the floor
It's a Man Ray kind of sky
Let me show you what I can do with it
Time and distance are out of place here

{The riff is like this:
(B) ------0------0------0------0----
(G) ----0------0------0------0------
(D) --------------------------------
(A) -----------------------0--------
(E) -0------2-------3---------------

Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed
                                        {start the riff again}
When the light is mine, I felt gravity pull

Somewhere near the end it said
"You can't do this", I said "I can too"
Shift sway rivers shift, oceans fall and mountains drift
It's a Man Ray kind of sky
Let me show you what I can do with it

Step up, step up, step up the sky is open-armed
                                          C           D
When the light is mine, I felt gravity pull onto my eyes,
C            D
holding my head straight (looking down).
 C                              B
This is the easiest task I've ever had to do...

Reason had harnessed the tame
Holding the sky in their arms

{The end follows these chords:  B  C  B  C  B  C  B C D B}
 Gravity pulls me down





   MAPS AND LEGENDS


{intro:}
Em   D2   Em   (A)  --0-h-2-----
               (E)  --------3--3-0

He's not to be reached, he's to be reached.
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached.

D2         Em           D2       Em
Called the fool and the company,
 D2     Em      F#m           A
On his own where he'd rather be.
 D2       Em       D2     Em       D2        Em    F#m          A/Asus4
Where he ought to be, he sees what you can't see, can't you see that?

Em         D2            Em
Maybe he's caught in the legend
Em         D2            Em
maybe he's caught in the mood.
Em          D2       Em
Maybe these maps and legends
Em        D2      Em
Have been misunderstood.

D2       Em      D2     Em
Down the way the road's divided,
D2           Em     F#m      A
Paint me the places you have seen.
D2        Em        D2      Em
Those who know what I don't know
D2    Em     D2      Em              F#m           A/Asus4
refer to the yellow, red and green

Em         D2            Em
Maybe he's caught in the legend
Em         D2            Em
maybe he's caught in the mood.
Em          D2       Em
Maybe these maps and legends
Em        D2      Em
Have been misunderstood.

{Break:}   D  Dm   F   C     D  Dm   F F    D  Dm   F  C
He's not to be reached, he's to be reached.  (4 times)

D2               Em       D2           Em
The map that you painted didn't seem real.
D2      Em       F#m      A
He just sings whatever he's seen
D2           Em      D2           Em
Point to the legend, point to the east,
D2           Em      D2      Em         F#m              A/Asus4
Point to the yellow, red and green

Em         D2            Em
Maybe he's caught in the legend,
Em         D2            Em
maybe he's caught in the mood.
Em          D2       Em
Maybe these maps and legends
Em        D2      Em
Have been misunderstood, been misunderstood. (Maps and legends)

(Maps and legends) Is he to be reached?  He's not to be reached.
(Maps and legends) Is he to be reached?  He's not to be reached.
(Maps and legends) Is he to be reached?  He's not to be reached anymore.




   DRIVER 8


riff:   (G) -------------------4---0---0---0---0---0---
        (D) ---------------s-5----5---5--4---2---0-----
        (A) --------2-0-2-3----------------------------
        (E) 0-0-2-3------------------------------------  repeat....

 Em            Am       G        G/F#
The walls are built up, stone by stone,
 Em            Am          G     G/F#
The fields divided one by one.
 Em                      Am
And the train conductor says
       G            G/F#      Em       Am
"Take a break driver 8, driver 8 take a break
            G                 G/F#
We've been on this shift too long".

 D         C                D
And the train conductor says
       C            D        C           D
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
       C              Em     Em/F#     Em/G    Em/F#     Em Em/F# Em/G Em/F#
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away"

{on that part, play the Em Em/F# Em/G Em chords, or this riff}:

(D)------0-------0------0--------0--
(A) ---2-------2------2-------2-----
(E) -0-------2------3------2--------

I saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm.
The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged.
Bells are ringing through the town again,
Children look up, all they hear is sky-blue, bells ringing

And the train conductor says
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away"

 Am                    C
Way to seal the hated heat.
 G                     D
Way to put myself to sleep.
 Am                    C
Way to shield the hated heat.
 G                      D/Dsus4
Way to put myself, my children to sleep.

He piloted this song in a plane like that one.
She is selling faith on the Go Tell crusade.
Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent, hear the bells ring again.
Field of wheat is looking thin

And the train conductor says
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We've been on this shift too long."
And the train conductor says
"Take a break Driver 8, Driver 8 take a break
We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away"

{repeat riff as necessary or play chords over verse}

C                                  D
Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way
C                          D
To doors to go between the wall was raised today
C                                               D
To doors remain before your others and your own
C                                       D
Keep these books well stocked away and take your happy home.

   G5                  Gsus4           G             Gsus4     D
My carpenter's out and running about, talking to the street
{same as before}
My pockets are out and running about
Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there

Burn bright through the night, two pockets lead the way
Two doors to go between the wall was raised today
Raise the walls and shout its flaws, a carpenter should rest
So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best

My carpenter's out and running about, talking to the street
My pockets are out and running about
Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there

{somewhere around her, there's that little break "Listen to the holler..."

chords are:  F  Fsus4     C     D

The hills ringing hear the words in time
Listen to the holler, listen to my walls within my tongue
Can't you see you made my ears go tin?
the air quicken tension building inference suddenly
Life and how to live it

Raise the walls and shout its flaws, a carpenter should rest
So that when you tire of one side the other serves you best
Read about the wisdom lost, a knock, a knock, a knock
A secret knock one hammer's locked the other wisdom lost

My carpenter's out and running about, talking to the street
My pockets are out and running about
Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there
My carpenter's out and running about, barking in the, listen to the holler
My pockets are out and running about
Barking in the street to tell what I have hidden there

Listen, listen to the holler,
If I write a book it will be called "Life and How to Live It"

Old Man Kensey wants to be a sign painter
First he's got to learn to read
He's gonna be a clown on TV
Flexes his elbow taunt and free
That's my folly, I believe
Drink up the lake Kensey's awake
That's my folly, that's my mistake

Old Man Kensey wants to be a goalie
First he's got to learn to count
He's gonna be a clown on a circus mount
Letters to be signed and dropped off
Kensey's going far
John, Bill and Ed, stand on your head
That's my folly, I'm ready to go

Old Man Kensey wants to be a dog catcher
First he's got to learn to stand
He's gonna be a clown in a marching band
Letters to be signed ransom greed
That's my folly, I believe
Drink up the lake, John, Bill and Ed,
That's my folly, that's my mistake
Kensey's awake, stand on your head
That's my folly, I'm ready to go

The wheelbarrow's fallen
Look at my hands
They've found some surplus cheaper hands
Rubbing palms and pick and choose,
who will they choose?  Here is the news.

Look at that building, look at this man
Haloed and whitewashed
Gone to find a cheaper hand
he'll offer a pound, offer a pound.

Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
The compass points the workers home

Pay for your freedom, find another gate
Guilt by associate, the rushes wilted a long time ago
Guilty as you go

Stay off that highway, word is it's not so safe
The grasses that hide the greenback
The amber waves of gain again
The amber waves of gain

Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
Green grow the rushes go
The compass points the workers home

Lyrics:

Who will stand alone?

She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Courage built a bridge, jealous tore it down
At least it's something you've left behind
Like Kohoutek, you were gone

We sat in the garden, we stood on the porch
I won't deny myself, we never talked

She wore bangles, she wore bells
On her toes and she jumped like a fish
Like a flyin' friend, you were gone
Like Kohoutek, can't forget that

Fever built a bridge, reason tore it down
If I am one to follow.. who will stand alone?

Maybe you're not the problem
scissors, paper, stone
If you stand and holler, these prayers will talk

She carried ribbons, she wore them out
Michael built a bridge...Michael tore it down
At least it's something you've left behind
Like Kohoutek, you were gone

Michael built a bridge... Michael tore it down
If I stand and holler... will I stand alone?

Lyrics:

She didn't want to get pinned down by her prior town
Get me to the train on time, here take this nickel make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end, I don't know another friend
Another wife, another morning spent
Listen, listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

We never wrote the reasons that I need explained
Some things are givens, and others get away
This time its for myself you call it what you may
Okay, we won't say goodbye so long, so much more
Listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

Listen to the bargain holler
Listen to the barter holler
Listen to the auctioneer

Get me to the train on time here take this nickel make a dime
Take this penny and make it into a necklace when I leave
What is at the other end, an I don't know another friend
Another wife, another morning spent
Listen to the auctioneer
Another engine, another engine

Do I stand the bargain holler?
Listen to the barter holler
Listen to the auctioneer

The basic chords for this song are E, D and A, although not the normal
open E, D and A.  There's also an Em and some picking as well.

Here are the chords as I hear them, but due to the numerous guitar
tracks on the studio version, your guess is as good as mine:

  E      D     A    Em    D-lick
E-0------0-----0----0-----2-----0--------------------------------------
B-0------0-----0----0-----3-3-----3---3--------------------------------
G-9------7-----6----0-----2---2-----2----------------------------------
D-9------7-----7----2-----0--------------------------------------------
A-7------5-----0----2--------------------------------------------------
E-0------X-----X----0--------------------------------------------------

The song fades in on the E chord and the verses go:
E
When you greet a stranger,     | Verse II:
D                              |   When you greet a stranger,
Look at his shoes.             |   Look at her hands,
A                       E      |   Keep your money in your hands,
Keep your money in your shoes, |   Put your travel behind.
         D-lick                |
Put your trouble behind.       |

Verse III:                         |  Verse IV:
At the end of the day,             |  When you greet a stranger,
I'll forget your name.             |  Look at his shoes.
I'd like it here if I couldn't     |  Keep your memories in your shoes,
Even see you from a long way away. |  Put your travel behind.

CHORUS (as above):

Break:
Em
At the end of the day,
When there are no friends.

Verse V: (wierd but it works)         Verse VI:
And there are no lovers.           |  Familiar face, a boring place,
Who are you going to call for?     |  I'll forget your name.
What do you have to change.        |  I'd like it here if I couldn't
(Mike Mills in the background)     |  Even see you from a long way away.

CHORUS (as above) END


@SONG: GOOD ADVICES

When you greet a stranger look at his shoes
Keep your money in your shoes put your trouble behind
When you greet a stranger look at his hands
Keep your money in your hands put your travel behind
Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say
Keep your hat on your head home is a long way away
At the end of the day, I'll forget your name
I'd like it here if I could leave and see you from a long way away

When you greet a stranger, look at her shoes
Keep you memories in your shoes, put your travel behind
Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say
Keep your hat on your head
Home is a long way away
At the end of the day, when there are no friends
When there are no lovers, who are you going to call for
What do you have to change

A familiar face a foreign place I forget your name
I'd like it here if I could leave and see you from a long way away
Who are you going to call for, what do you have to say
Keep your hat on your head
Home is a long way away



   WENDELL GEE


 C                    Dm
 That's when Wendell Gee takes a tug
   G         G7         Em               G
 Upon the string that held the line of trees
 C                    Dm
 Behind the house he lived in
           G             G7
 He was reared to give respect
       Em                 G        F
 But somewhere down the line he chose
                     C Em F
 To whistle as the wind  blows
  F              C      G           C
 Whistle as the wind   blows, with me

{same as before}
He had a dream one night
That the tree had lost its middle
So he built a trunk of chicken wire
To try to hold it up
But the wire, the wire turned to lizard skin
And when he climbed inside

 F                  C        Em     F
There wasn't even time to say
 F                  C        G      F
Goodbye to Wendell Gee
                  C    Em     F
So whistle as the wind blows
               C    G            C  (second time through, play F)
Whistle as the wind blows, with me

                  C      Em      F
If the wind were colors
                     C     G   F
And if the air could speak
                      C      Em  F
Then whistle as the wind blows
                C     G     C
Whistle as the wind blows
