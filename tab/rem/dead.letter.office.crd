Listen

{continue with riff}
You're funny and you don't know why
You're funny and you can't even cry
You're funny and you don't know why
You're funny and you don't even try

             F                         C
Cause your head's shaking cause your arms are shaking
           F                           G
And your feet are shaking cause the earth is shaking

{play as before with riff}
You're hungry and you don't know why
You're hungry and you can't even cry
You're hungry and you don't know why
You're hungry and you don't even cry

  {at this point in the song, the riff is altered slightly,
   it looks something like this....

                        {"nothing   can hurt      you ")

You take a walk and you try to understand
Nothing can hurt you
Unless you want it to
There are no answers
Many reasons to be strong
You take a walk you take a walk
You take a walk and you try to understand

{break  like chorus    F   C   F   G}

 {go back to opening riff}
You're in love and you don't know why
You're in love and you can't even cry
You're in love and you don't know why
You're in love and you don't even try

Lyrics:
(derived from the liner notes to the gospel album "The Joy of Knowing Jesus,"
by The Revelaires)

Reverend Bill Funderburk sings "He Cared That Much For Me";
Charles Surratt introduces his own composition "On Calvary For Me";
"The Joy of Knowing Jesus" is a song of pure delight featuring John Barbee;

The pure tenor quality of the voice of Harold Montgomery
gives a special interpretation to the grand old hymn "The Old Rugged Cross";
Chill bumps appear and I am frozen in the web they weave as they reveal their
innermost selves with the outpouring of their hearts...

On and on the songs roll and soon you are caught up
in the sermon in each rendition as you come to feel
the devotion and dedication that is poured forth.
Suddenly, you know they are real, they mean it!

"Let your light so shine..."
could not be more aptly applied
as there shines a light from heaven on your heart
through their singing.  As an artist, Rhonda Montgomery
exemplifies piano artistry.  That's Rhonda!  An artist!

This album can be the instrument to mend a broken heart
or to straighten out your life through the sincere testimony
in the songs of THE REVELAIRES.  A must!

Lyrics:

Light voices scream nothing seems real's a dream
Leaving the things that you learned behind
Leaving the things that you love behind
All of the things that you learned were real
Nothing except for the years
Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream
Toys toys toys in the attic

Light voices scream nothing seems real's a dream
Leaving the things that you love behind
Leaving the things that you learned behind
All of the things that you learned were real
Nothing except for the years
Voices scream, nothing seems real's a dream
Toys toys toys in the attic
