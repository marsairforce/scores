   LAST DATE


I don't have the details of the song written down, but LAST DATE is
basically just C, F and G.  As written by Floyd Cramer, it was just a
piano solo with a bit of percussion, vocal "ooohs", bass and strings,
so it sounds best if you play it on a piano instead of a guitar (IMHO).

If you can figure out the melody line to go over-top the chords, I can
give you the chords... hang on a second while I put the CD on and I'll
type the chords as I hear them...  bars are separated by slashes...

Intro
F   /  F Em Dm / C     / C Bm Am / G  / G  / G / G

Verse
C / C / C / C (bass line goes C D E) / F / F / F / F Em Dm
C / C / C / C / F / F / F / F Em Dm
C / C / C / C / F / F / F / F Em Dm

Chorus
C / C / F / F/ C / C / F / F/ C / C / G / G / C / C / G / G

Verse again
Chorus again

Verse again (with improv guitar jazzy melody)
Chorus

End
F  / Em / Dm / C

AFTERHOURS (Velvet Underground)


 (1,2,3)
        C         A7
 If you close the door
     Dm                  G
 The night could last forever
           C        A7
 Leave the sunshine out
     Dm             G
 And say hello to never



         C                              C7
 All the people are talking and they're having such fun
   F                         Fm
 I wish this could happen to me
            C         A7
 But if you close the door
      Dm            G            C
 I'll never have to see the day again




            C         A7
 But if you close the door
     Dm                  G
 The night could last forever
           C          A7
 Leave the wine glass out
     Dm               G
 And drink a toast to never


 C                           C7
 Someday I know someone will look into my eyes
            F
 And say hello
                        Fm
 You're my very special one
            C         A7
 But if you close the door
      Dm            G           C        (Bass line to bridge: C-B-Bb)
 I'll never have to see the day again



 Bridge:

 Am         E7          Am       E7
 Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
     Am        E7          Am        Am-G#-G
 And people on subways and trains
         Dm          A7           Dm         A7
 Looking grey in the rain as they stand disarrayed
       F                       G
 Oh but people look well in the dark



        C         A7
 If you close the door
     Dm                  G
 The night could last forever
           C        A7
 Leave the sunshine out
     Dm           G
 And say hello to never
 C                           C7
 Someday I know someone will look into my eyes
         F
 And say hello
                        Fm
 You're my very special one
            C         A7
 But if you close the door
      Dm            G           C       A7
 I'll never have to see the day again
     Dm            G           C       A7
 I'll never have to see the day again (once more)
      Dm            G           C
 I'll never have to see the day again




ARMS OF LOVE (Robin Hitchcock)


I've tried to lay out the rythym as graphically as possible.

(d = down, ^ = up)

d    d ^    ^  d ^  d    d ^    ^  d ^  d    d ^    ^  d    d    d ^    ^  d ^


G                   C                   G              C    G
(intro, same as first sung line)
G                   C                   G              C    G
 Maybe            tonight you're        achin'
G                   F                   C                   C
 For someone you're dreamin'           of
D                   D                   C                   C
Tomorrow            you'll be           wakin               Into the
D                   D/G*                C                   C
Arms, into the      arms of             Love

(*You could use either a D, D/G, or a G here, whatever suits you best.)

Maybe tonight you're cryin
Like a poor wounded dove
Tell me you'll soon be flying
Into the Arms, into the arms of love

Maybe tonight you're takin
You couldn't get enough
Honey you'll soon be wakin'
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love

[Interlude, use same three lines of chords that run through the sung
 verse.]

Maybe the world is falling
It wasn't strong enough
Tell me you'll soon be crawling
Into the Arms, into the arms of Love
(repeat to end)

Lyrics:

Chance, chance, chance, chance

Friday bank card yours got stuck
I loaned you a phone quarter, said "Good luck"
Where are you now?

Me and glasses Saturday slump
You and your shopping, I looked up
Our eyes met, mine are green
You'd had a peroxide thing
Call now, look me up

Sunday walk, Weaver's Park,
I was on the lakeside
Where the playgrounds meet
In bare feet
You said, "Mighty cold today"
You never see what I think
You didn't like your daytime job
I was born to travel

You were a camera, I dropped my keys
I'm on the northbound, you were asleep
I said, "Are you holding?"
"You wanna ride the silent sky?"
I wrote a story on the fly
You in the tabletop
I said, "I've had enough of the city."

I held a bag of apples
You at the last table
I have had a sorry day (?)
Cafe' streetside, Tuesday bloom
You wanna be on fire, I said I'm in the moon (?)

Wednesday grocery, corner of Vine,
You were in the checkout line
I dropped my frozen dinners, you helped pick them up

Thursday cab rush, our block,
You with broken accent, my heart stopped
You laughed, I worry

Chance, chance, chance, chance
Swarming like a dozen crushing blows
All those glances, midtime dances
Chance

I never looked it up
You hit the sidewalk talking
Said, "I'd read the ads"
Do you?
Where are you?  Will you read this?  Can I see?
This is surely moving faster than I can think

A minute shy, a passing eye
I know I saw you there
Will you read this?  Can I see?  What did I see?
Chance, chance, chance, chance
Swimming like a dozen crushing blows
All those midtime dances
Chance

Guys, this is very tedious... stop!





DARK GLOBE (Syd Barrett)


G
Oh where are you now, pussy willow that smiled on this leaf?
C                               D               G
When I was alone you promised a stone from your heart.
                   G7
My head kissed the ground
                   C
I was half the way down
             G     D
Treading the sand, please...
G             C         D      C
Please lift a hand, I'm only a person
      D         C            D
Whose arm bands beads on his hands hang tall.
G                  D
Won't you miss me,
D7
Wouldn't you miss me at all?
G
The poppy bird's way swing twigs coffee brands around.   ???
C                               D
Brandish a wand with a feathery tong.
G                  G7
My head kissed the ground
                   C
I was half the way down
             G     D       C
Treading the sand, please, please...
G             C         D      C
Please lift a hand, I'm only a person.
D           C       D           C             C7
With eskimo chain I tattered my brain all the way
G                 D
Won't you miss me,
D7
Wouldn't you miss me at all?

(OUTRO: putter around on G for a while, then stop.)

Lyrics:

I was hungry when I said
I never got to sleep
You go ahead
You can get whatever you want
There's a feeling in my belly
It's the new tomorrow scene
It's an interesting job
It's the fireworks

CHORUS
I don't need it (I don't need it)
I hit my head (he hit his head)
I can't feel anything
You gave too much away
You came to say
It's a free world baby
And you gave too much away

(get whatever you want)

Me, I'm tired of this candy
My teeth ache my head
Boys in bed, girls in bed
All now go to sleep
Sleep, sweet dreams
Wake to a new today tomorrow

CHORUS

Boys in bed, girls in bed
All now go to sleep
Sleep, sweet dreams
Wake to a new today tomorrow
Sleep, sweet dreams
Wake to a new today tomorrow

CHORUS

Lyrics:

He's got his work, and she comes easy
They each come around when the other is gone
Me, I think I got stuck somewhere in between
I wouldn't confide in the prodigal son,
The dye has been cast, the battle is won
The bullets were blanks, a double locked gun
I couldn't admit to a minute of fun.

And they come and they come and they come
I accept it with a gentle tongue
No words spoken, no ? kept

Take it, stomp twice, ring bell
Tether that ringing, freeze
Enough with the rifle and talk already
We all know what it means
Take this conversation to your great divide
I can only swallow what I ate,
And I don't hate him, and I don't hate her.

And they come and they come and they come
I accept it with a gentle tongue
No heart broken, no ? kept

Don't talk to me about being alone
Don't talk to me about being alone
Don't talk to me about being alone

Reach for each other before you leave
Reach peace, P-E-A-C-E
Don't threaten me with a gentle tease,
Don't threaten me with angry
Please please please don't try to tell me what I am

And they come and they come and they come
I accept it with a gentle tongue
No words spoken, no ? except

Don't talk to me about being alone
Don't talk to me about being alone
Don't talk to me about being alone....

Ends on Em.

FIRST WE TAKE MANHATTAN (Leonard Cohen)


        Dm                             Am
They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
       Dm                              Am
For trying to change the system from within
       Dm                       Am
I'm coming now I'm coming to reward   them
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

       Dm                        Am
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens
       Dm                         Am
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin
       Dm                         Am
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

    C                                G    F
I'd really like to live beside you, baby
              C                             Am
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
         C                                       Am
But you see that line there moving through the station
    G          F          E                      Am
I told you I told you I told you I was one of those

       Dm                              Am
You loved me as a loser but now your worried that I just might win
     Dm                             Am
You know the way to stop me but you don't have the discipline
     Dm                                Am
How many nights I prayed for this: to let my work begin
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

Dm                                   Am
I don't like your fashion business, mister
Dm                                      Am
I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
Dm                                  Am
I don't like what happened to your sister
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin  (chorus)

       Dm                                Am
And I thank you for those items that you sent me
    Dm                         Am
The monkey end the plywood violin
    Dm                               Am
I practiced every night and now I'm ready
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

   Dm                            Am
Remember me, I used to live for music
   Dm                                  Am
Remember me, I brought your groceries in
       Dm                          Am
It's Father's Day and everybody's wounded
  G                  F  E                 Am
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

C#m             B
   I found this photograph,
A
underneath the broken picture glass.
C#m            A
Tender face of black and white,
C#m          A
Beautiful, a haunting sight.


C#m            B
Looked into an angel's smile,
A
captivated all the while.
C#m               A
>From the hair and clothes she wore,
C#m            A
I'd place her in between the wars.


E               B
Was she willing when she sat
    A                D
and posed the pretty photograph?
E                  B
Save her flowering and fair,
    A                 D
the days to come, the days to share.
E     B     D  Dsus2
A big smile for the camera,
A           D
how did she know?
    E            B       D   Dsus2
the moment could be lost forever
A  C#m
forever more


C#m             B
   I found this photograph,
A
stashed between the old joist walls,
C#m              A
in a place where time is lost,
C#m                A
lost behind, where all things fall.

C#m              B
Broken books and calendars,
A
letters script in careful hand,
C#m          A
music too, a standard tune by
C#m            A
some forgotten big brass band.


E                   B
>From the threshhold what's to see
A
of our brave new century?
E                B
The television's just a dream,
A
the radio, the silver screen.
E     B     D  Dsus2
A big smile for the camera,
A           D
how did she know?
    E            B       D   Dsus2
the moment could be lost forever
A  C#m
forever more


Bridge: {play intro riff 3 times}


E B D Dsus2 A D (repeats) last repeat replace last D with C#m

E                 B
Was her childhood filled with rhymes,
A             D
stolen hooks, impassioned crimes?
E           B
Was she innocent or blind
A              D
to the cruelty of her time?
E               B
Was she fearful in her day,
A                D
was she hopeful, did she pray?
E               B
Were there skeletons inside,
A               D
family secrets, sworn to hide?
E                B
Did she feel the heat that stirs,
A                      D
the fall from grace of wayward girls?
E               B
Was she tempted to pretend,
A                      D
the love and laughter, 'til the end?

THE WALL OF DEATH (Richard Thompson)


These are the chords for the Richard Thompson version, taken from
ftp.nevada.edu....

(12 string is played capoed 2nd fret,
chords are written here at concert pitch.
Play rhythm part with lots of suspensions
and D scale runs, especially on the A and D chords)

Intro A D A D A D A D

       A                   D              A   Asus4 A
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
A A/G# F#m                 D              E
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
        D
You can waste your time on the other rides
    E
but this is the nearest to being alive
A              D              E       A   Asus4 A
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

You can go with the crazy people in the crooked house
You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse
The tunnel of love might amuse you
And Noah's Ark might confuse you but
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

       Bm      F#m
On the Wall of Death
        Bm       F#m      E
All the World is far from me
       Bm      F#m
On the Wall of Death
         Bm         F#m   D     E
It's the nearest to being free

Well you're going nowhere when you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong, but what's the good of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy
Beware of the bearded lady
Oh let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

(guitar solo over bridge chords)
