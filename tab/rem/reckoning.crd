   REM: RECKONING

   HARBORCOAT (Version 1)


{This song is actually played in Eb on the record. This transcription in
 E won't go along much with the album unless you tune down.}

 {intro   E  G#m  A / Asus2}

 C#m                   E                               A  B
They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off
 C#m                   E                               A  B
A handshake is worthy if it's all that you've got
 C#m                   E                               A  B
Metal shoes on wood push through our back
            C#m                E                       A  B
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "REACT"

/F#m   G#m/  x 3     F#m7

{same as before}
They shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
Reddened their necks, collared their clothes
Then we danced the dance till the menace got out
She gathered the corners and called it her gown

 E     G#m         A/Asus2 E    G#m        A/Asus2
Please find my harborcoat, can't go outside without it
 E     G#m         A/Asus2 E    G#m        A/Asus2
       Find my harborcoat, can't go outside without it

{same as other verses}
They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off
A handshake is worthy if it's all that you've got
Metal shoes on wood push through our back
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "REACT", R-E-A-C-T

{break  Em  with 12th fret harmonics  played fast and furiously}

They shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
Reddened their necks, collared their clothes
Then we danced the dance till the menace got out
She gathered the corners and called it her gown

She said...
{end on F#m}

She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
She's got pretty persuasion

It's what I want, hurry and buy,
all has been tried, follow reasoning,
And I put that in this heat it's all wrong
Try to wear that on my sleeve it's all wrong all wrong

He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
God damn, pure confusion
He's got pretty persuasion

In the line of heart,
All is peeling away,

It's what I want, hurry and buy,
all has been tried, follow reason and buy,
Try to put that in this heat it's all wrong
Cannot wear that on your sleeve it's all wrong it's all wrong





   TIME AFTER TIME (ANNELISE)


The tune is in E flat, but uses standard RES chord shapes.

Play the main riff and chorus on a guitar tuned to F, or tuned normally and
capoed to the first fret, or tuned to E flat and capoed on the second fret.

Play the 2nd guitar part on a guitar tuned to E flat, so you can get the drone
effect.  You can just play the 1st and 2nd strings if you want.

Play the 3rd guitar part (ringing chords) on a guitar tuned to E flat, using
this shape:
Eb chord shape:  079900

Main riff (tune to F or capo 1st fret)
F--|-0----0-0-0---3-3-sl-5-0---- This is the main riff and repeats many times
C--|-3----3-3-3---3-3--------0-- throughout the song.  I believe that the main
Ab-|-2----2-2-2---2-2----------- chord here is Dsus2 with some extra picking
Eb-|-0----0-0-0---0-0----------- thrown in. Wierd, but not so hard once you get
Bb-|---------------------------- the hang of it. Tune to F to maximize ringing
F--|---------------------------- of open strings.  (Or play in standard tuning
                                 with capo on 1st fret).

2nd guitar (tune to E flat)
Eb-|-0-0-0-0----0-0-0-0---| This is the droning heard through most of the song.
Bb-|-5-5-5-5----5-5-5-5---| Play with either two or three strings, your choice.
Gb-|-9-9-9-9--------------|
Db-|----------------------|
Ab-|----------------------|
Eb-|----------------------|

Fm        Ab          Eb

End on Eb chord (7th fret)

Notes:  There are three guitars on this song.  One (tuned to F?) plays the
main riff.  The second basically drones on Eb notes, played on two strings at
once.  A 12 string would be ideal for this part.  A third guitar plays the Eb
chord on the seventh fret (with open Eb and Bb strings).  It sounds like
there's more going on due to the interaction of these parts.





   SECOND GUESSING

End on E





   LETTER NEVER SENT


       This, as most songs on Reckoning, is based on the D chord. I play it
       by making a D chord but without putting my first finger on the high E
       string.  This makes it easier to do the fingerings needed for this
       song.  Basically it goes pretty much like this :

       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       -----------------------3-----------------------------------------
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       0-0-0-0-4-4-4-4-2-2-2----0---0-----------------------------------
       2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-0-0-0------3-------------------------------------
       -----------------------------------------------------------------

       After the beginning part there are these series of chords :

       D D D D G G C C C C D D D D G G C C C C

       And then the chorus:

       A               G          A         G        A        G
       Heaven's yours           Heavens   yours     Heavens yours...etc

       There there is this part:

       Bm         A        D           Bm     A       G
       When I'm moving too fast       Where's my new address?



Lyrics:

It's been pretty simple so far, vacation in Athens is calling me
And knock, knock, knock on wood, I thought I'd left you behind
Heaven is yours, heaven is yours, heaven's yours where I live

The thought of the catacombs left my soul at home
This letter never sent
And it's so far, it's so dark, i'm so lost
Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
  (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
When I'm moving too fast, where's my new address?

The water is evening now, the catacombs are filling in
If my soul was made of stone, no, not, not so dark, dark

And it's so far, it's so dark, i'm so lost
And it's so far, it's so far, it's so far

Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
 (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)
Heaven's yours, heaven's yours, heaven's yours where I live
 (Another story, another story for a while, someone show me)





   CAMERA


So, let's call this "riff a".

D(4) !0-----------0-2-!3-------------0-!2---------------!----------------!
A(5) !----------------!----------------!----------------!------0---0---0-!

D(4) !0-----------0-2-!3-------------0-!2---------------!----------------!
A(5) !----------------!----------------!----------------!1-----1---0---0-!

That's the first eight measures of the song.  In fact, that's the bass line for

all the verses.  If you have a bass and a guitar both, the bass should play
this throughout (except for the chorus) and the guitar should not come in until

the third line of the first verse ("when the party lulls...").  If you have
just a guitar, then you should play this for the first two lines of the first
verse.

We'll call this "riff b".

e(1) !5-------------5-!----------------!------3---------!0-----0-----0---!
B(2) !3-----------3---!------3---------!----0-----0-----!--3-----3-----3-!
G(3) !2---------2-----!--2-------2-----!--2---------2---!----0-----0-----!
D(4) !0-------0-------!3-----------3-0-!2-------------2-!----------------!

There is, of course, ad lib. on the actual recording, but this is the basic
pattern.

And this is "riff c".
                 (slide)
e(1) !------------5/10!8-------------10!7-------------!----------------!
B(2) !----------3-----!----------------!---------10p8h!10----10--------!
G(3) !--------2-------!                   (pull-off and hammer-on)
D(4) !0---------------!

Also, throughout the chorus, there's a pretty typical sus4/add2 chord pattern;
for example, on the D chord, do something like this to the note on e(1):
e(1) !2-----2-2-3---5-!--3---2---0---2-!
Do the same thing on the second string while playing the A chord at the end of
the chorus.  On the C chord, hammer-on to the third fret on the second string
(Cadd2) in a similar pattern.


verse 1
       /From the inside room when the front room greeting
riff a
       \Becomes your special book, it was simple then

riff b  When the party lulls, if we fall by the side

riff b  Will you be remembered?  Will she be remembered?  (Asus4/A)

chorus
        G               D C                        D
        Alone in a crowd, a bartered lantern borrowed
        G                   D     C                       A
        If I'm to be your camera, then who will be your face?

verse 2
riff b  I fell by your bed once; I didn't want to tell you
riff b  I should keep myself inbetween th pages
riff b  Of the green light room if we fall by the side
riff b  Will you be remembered?  Will she be remembered?  (Asus4/A)

chorus

play riff c twice, then:

verse 3
riff c  From the inside room when the front room greeting
riff b  Becomes your special book, it was simple then
riff b  When the party lulls, if we fall by the side
riff b  I still like you; can you rememeber?  (Asus4/A)

chorus twice





   (DON'T GO BACK TO) ROCKVILLE


 {intro : E / / /  E / / / E / /  /  Esus4 E EaddF# E}

  E                                                                 A/Asus4
 Looking at your watch a third time waiting in the station for a bus
  E                                                                 A/Asus4
 Going to a place that's far, so far away and if that's not enough
  B             A     G#m  C#m                              Bm        A/Asus4
 Going where nobody says hello, they don't talk to anybody they don't know

         E                                                                  A
 You'll wind up in some factory that's full time filth and nowhere left to go
  E                                                   A/Asus4
 Walk home to an empty house, sit around all by yourself
     B                       A      G#m   C#m
 I know it might sound strange, but I believe
                           Bm       A/Asus4   A A/G#bass   A/F#bass
 You'll be coming back before too long

  E                F#m    B
 Don't go back to Rockville
  A                                      (B)  3-2-0---0-2--3-2-0--0
 And waste another year     riff:        (G)  ------2------------2

{same as above}
At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend
I don't care if you're not here with me
'Cause it's so much easier to handle
All my problems if I'm too far out to sea
But something better happen soon
Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

  E                           D    B     A  B
 It's not as though I really need you
  E                           F#m  B     A  B
 If you were here I'd only bleed you
  F#m      C#m          F#m         C#m               A
 But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down and
                             B
 That's not how it ought to be

{same as before}
I know it might sound strange, but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

Lyrics:

I can't see myself at thirty, I don't buy a lacquered thirty
Caught like flies, preserved for tomorrow's jewelery, again
Lighted in the amber yard, a green shellback, green shellback
Preserved for tomorrow's eyes, in tree beer tar-black brer sap,
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost

Who will tend the farm museums?  Who will dust today's belongings?
Who will sweep the floors, hedging near the givens?
Rally round your leaders it's the mediator season
Diane is on the beach, do you realize the life she's led?
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
The consul a horse, oh man I think we're lost
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
A matter of course, Jefferson, Jeffer

Lighted in the amber yard, a green shellback, green shellback
Sky-lied, sty-tied, Nero pie-tied, in tree tar-black brer sap,
Reason has harnessed the tame, a lodging, not stockader's game
Another Greenville, another Magic Mart, Jeffer, grab your fiddle,
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost
The biggest wagon is the empty wagon is the noisiest,
The consul a horse, Jefferson I think we're lost
