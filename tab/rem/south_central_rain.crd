Pretty good job, especially with the lyrics.  The chord following
Cm, though, should be Bb (or A#).

hmmm... I'm beginning to wonder if there aren't as many versions of the
chords as there are of the lyrics.  I always played it something like
C/Em/Bb/F/C/Em/Bb6/F/C, though I guess that both the Bb's could just as
well be Gm7's, since I don't play the F on the high E the first time, and
I add the 6th (G) for the second one.  Cm especially doesn't sound right
to me, though it seems that [Gm7/Bb6] followed by Bb (instead of F)
could work.  Blargh, have to go listen to it some more I guess.

The "Dm" for the "I'm sorry..." part is only marginally a Dm, it's
mainly a D5add9:
                                               (add9)

       ^ these are the only hint of^ a minor third..
