{t:SHAKING THROUGH}
{st: REM}

{c:intro}
{sot}
(E) ---5---3---2---0---
(B) ---7---5---3---2---
(G) ---7---5---2---0---
(D) --steady 1/8 notes all the way
{eot}

{ci: Play melody line on the E string with D Dsus2 and Dsus4}

[D]Could it be that [Bm]one small voice d[D]oesn't count in the [Bm]world
[Em]Yellow like a geisha [A]dawn [Em]deny it all the [A]way

Could this be three beaten
Autumn marches on
Yellow like a geisha dawn deny it all the way

[D]Sh[A]aking [G]throu[(A)]gh a[D]ll t[A]he [G]day

Or have we gone way too far
Taking after rain
Yellow like a geisha dawn deny it all the way
Shaking through all the day
Shaking through opportune
[Em]In my l[A]ife       [Em]     [A]

Is that a steal
Children of today on parade
Yellow like a geisha dawn deny it all the way
Shaking through all the day

{ci:At the end, play chorus a key up : E B A, then end on B}
