	    B / / / B / / / E / / / D/Dsus4   
  the melody on the break isn't too hard to pick out. The notes
 are real close to the chords - often in them}

 And no one ever knew that it could be so strange...strange
 Hello I'm sorry I lost myself
 I think I thought you were someone else
 
 
 
 GET UP

{intro: E B C G A       E B C G Bb}
 
A                  D
 Sleep delays my life        
		       A
 Where does the time go...go
	   D
 I don't know
		       A
 Sleep sleep sleepy head

 Wake it up...up                
		       A
 You've got all your life
	   D
 Way up ahead
 
  E      B     C    G        A
 Dreams they complicate my life
  E      B     C    G        Bb
 Dreams they compliment my life
 
 I've seen you laying pined
 I've seen you laying pined
 Life is rough...rough
 I've seen you laying down...down
 With the loving kind
 I know life is hard...hard
 Well now
 Where to turn?

{break   A  D    A   D    w/  13  alarm clocks going off at once}
 
 This time there's no escape
 To dreamtime



YOU ARE THE EVERYTHING
{intro   Am}

G                                  D
Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing
			  G
I'm very scared for this world
		    D
I'm very scared for me
		   G
Eviscerate your memory
	 G
Here's a scene
       D     
You're in the back seat laying down
    G      
The windows wrap around you
    D     
The sound of the travel and the engine
C               G                  C 
All you hear is time stand still in travel
			  G
You feel such peace and absolue
			   C
The stillness still that doesn't end
		   G
But slowly drifts into sleep
      D                         
The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen
     D
And they're there for you
     D                            G
For you alone you are the everything
     G                 D           
I think about this world a lot and I cry
      G                         D
And I've seen the films and the eyes
		  G
But I'm in this kitchen
	  D
Everything is beautiful 
	  G
And she is so beautiful
		 D     
She is so young and old
		  C
I look at her and I see the beauty 
     G
Of the light of music
      C                       G
The voice is talking somewhere in the house 
		 C
Late spring and you're drifting off to sleep
	 D
With your teeth in your mouth
D    
You are here with me
D
You are here with me
D                     Am 
You have been here and you are everything
	  

 
STAND

{intro:  E   A   B}
 
   E           A                B
 Stand in the place where you live
  A    A/G# E    
 Now face North
  E            A
 Think about direction
	  F#        B  A    E
 Wonder why you haven't before
       E            A               B
 Now stand in the place where you were
  A  A/G#  E
 Now face West
  E                 A
 Think about the place where you live
  F#              B  A   E
 Wonder why you haven't before
 
  E             A       C#       C    B
 If you are confused check with the sun
  E        A         G        A B
 Carry a compass to help you along
       E         A       C#    C   B
 Your feet are going to be on the ground
       E         A       G     G A B
 Your head is there to move you around
 
 Your feet are going to be on the ground
 Your head is there to move you around
 If wishes were trees the trees would be falling
 Listen to reason
 The reason is calling

{at the end of this song, it goes up a key, so the chords are:
F#  B  C# .....
then they go up again to:
G#  C#  D# .....
however, the song ends on:
     E
so STAND!
 
 

 WORLD LEADER PRETEND
 
 {between the Em and Bm chords play this ----
  (D) -0-2-4-2-0-                  }

{intro  Em   Bm   Em   Bm  Em   Bm    G     A }
 
  D            G    C                 D
 I sit at my table and wage war on myself
  D   G               C                  D
 It seems like it's all...it's all for nothing
  D           G         C
 I know the barricades, and
	       D             D
 I know the mortar in the wall breaks
      G                  C                 D
 I recognize the weapons, I used them well
 
  Em  Bm
  Em                  Bm
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good
  Em                     Bm                            G    A
 I raised the wall, and I will be the one to knock it down
 
 I've a rich understanding of my finest defenses
 I proclaim that claims are left unstated,
 I demand a rematch
 I decree a stalemate
 I divine my deeper motives
 I recognize the weapons
 I've practiced them well. I fitted them myself
 
 It's amazing what devices you can sympathize...empathize
 This is my mistake.  Let me make it good
 I raised the walls, and I will be the one to knock it down
 
{I lose track of where the chords occur over the words. They just
 switch between Am and C  until the last part of this section...}

  Am            C          Am                     C
 Reach out for me and hold me tight.  Hold that memory
     Am           C           Am             A           G
 Let my machine talk to me.  Let my machine talk to me
 
 This is my world
 And I am the world leader pretend
 This is my life
 And this is my time
 I have been given the freedom
 To do as I see fit
 It's high time I've razed the walls
 That I've constructed
 
 It's amazing what devices you can sympathize...emapathize
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good
 I raised the walls, and I will be the one to knock it down
 
 You fill in the mortar. You fill in the harmony
 You fill in the mortar. I raised the walls
 And I'm the only one
 I will be the one to knock it down
{end on Em}



ORANGE CRUSH
{intro:   Em      G        D2}
 
  Em         
 Follow me don't follow me
       G                 D     
 I've got my spine I've got my orange crush
  Em                 
 Collar me don't collar me
       G                 D
 I've got my spine I've got my orange crush
  Em            G
 We are agents of the free
	D
 I've had my fun and now its time to
  Em            
 Spread your conscience overseas
  G              D
 Coming in fast over me


{the break is:   Emajor     B        F#     B   as many times as necessary}
   
 Paid in full {that's an awesome line!}
 
 
 
HAIRSHIRT


{This song repeats these 8 measures throughout the verses:
G / / / G / / / A7 / / / A7 / / / C / / / C / / / G / / / G / / /}
 
 I am not the type of dog
 That could keep you waiting
 For no good reason
 Run a carbon-black test on my jaw 
 And you will find it's all been said before
 
  G    A7             C                      Am
 I can swing my megaphone and long arm the rest
	Am
 It's easier and better
			     C      C
 To just beat it from the chest
 Of desire       G
 
 {verse}
 I could walk into this room
 And the waves of conversation are enough
 To knock you down in the undertow
 So alone so alone in my life
 Feed me banks of light
 And hang your hairshirt on the lowest rung 
 It's a beautiful life
 And I can hang my hairshirt 
 Away up high in the attic of the wrong dog's life chest
 Or bury it at sea
 All my life I've searched for this
 
 Here I am here I am in your life
 It's a beautiful life
 My life
 It's a beautiful life
 Your life
 
 
(UNTITLED)

C           
This world is big and so-awake
G                   C
I stayed up late to hear your voice
C                               
This light is here to keep you warm
			       G
This song is here to keep you strong


I made a list of things to say
But all I really want to say
All I really want to say is
Hold her and keep him strong
While I'm away from here
Hold her and keep her strong
While I'm away from here
   {break:    F7   C   F7   G}

I've seen the world and so-awake
And stay up late to hear me sing
Just hold her
I've seen the world and so-awake
And stay up late to hear me sing
Just hold him
Hold her and keep her strong
While I'm away from here
Hold him and keep him strong
While I'm away from here
