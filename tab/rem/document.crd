   DISTURBANCE AT THE HERON HOUSE


{The main riff goes something like this:}

(B) --keep a finger on the 3rd fret
(G) ---2-0-(0)-4-2-2-2-4---0---
(D) -0-0-0-(0)-0-0-0-0-0-2---0-
(A) -every other time, play this string open...

{I'm pretty sure that Peter is just picking a Dsus2 chord throughout
 the whole verse, but Mills is doing other "stuff" on the bass. I play
 the chords Dsus2 and Dsus2/C just to make it interesting.}

        D      D/C        D        D/C
 "They're going wild," the call came in
       D      D/C   D         D/C
 At early morning pre-dawn, then
     D   D/C      D
 "The followers of chaos out of control
       D   D/C       D   D/C
 They're numbering the monkeys
       D    D/C          D   D/C
 The monkeys and the monkeys,"
       D     D/C     D
 The followers of chaos out of control

 "They're meeting at the monument,"
 The call came in the monument
 To liberty and honor under the honor roll
 "They've gathered up the cages the cages and courageous,"
 The followers of chaos out of control

       G               A
 The call came in to Party Central
   G       A       G        A
 "Meeting of the green and simple,"
  G              A
 Try to tell us something we don't know

{The break is:    C   F    C    F  then on to opening riff...}

 "Disturbance at the Heron House"
 A stampede at the monument
 To liberty and honor under the honor roll
 The gathering of grunts and greens
 Cogs and grunts and hirelings
 A meeting of a mean idea to hold
 "When feeding time has come and gone
 They'll lose the heart and head for home
 Try to tell us something we don't know"




   STRANGE (Wire)


{intro:   G/ G/ G/ C x 4 }

 G                                C
There's something strange going on tonight
 G                                  C
There's something going on that's not quite right
 G                                          C
Michael's nervous and the lights are bright
 G                                     C
There's something going on that's not quite right

 E                               Esus4
There's something going on that wasn't here before
 E              Esus4
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
 E                                Esus4
There's something strange going on tonight
 E                                Esus4
There's something going on that's not quite right


There's something going on that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's going to say goodnight
There's something going on that's not quite right




   IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT (AND I FEEL FINE)


G                               C                            G
That's great, it starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes, an aeroplane -
                C            G
Lenny Bruce is not afraid.  Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn -
C                                                           G
world serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs.  Feed it up a knock,
                                C
speed, grunt no, strength no.  Ladder structure clatter with fear of height,
              Bb                                              A
down height.  Wire in a fire, represent the seven games in a government for
hire and a combat site.

{same as before}
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies
breathing down your neck.  Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered
crop.  Look at that low plane!  Fine then.  Uh oh, overflow, population,
common group, but it'll do.  Save yourself, serve yourself.  World serves its
own needs, listen to your heart bleed.  Tell me with the rapture and the
reverent in the right - right.  You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright
light, feeling pretty psyched.

       G            D          Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
       G            D          Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
       G            D          Am                  C     C/B
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine

Six o'clock - TV hour.  Don't get caught in foreign tower.  Slash and burn,
return, listen to yourself churn.  Lock him in uniform and book burning,
blood letting.  Every motive escalate.  Automotive incinerate.  Light a candle,
light a motive.  Step down, step down.  Watch a heel crush, crush.  Uh oh,
this means no fear - cavalier.  Renegade and steer clear!  A tournament,
a tournament, a tournament of lies.  Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives
and I decline.

       G            D          Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
       G            D          Am
It's the end of the world as we know it
       G            D          Am                  C     C/B
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine

  G      C       G       C      G      F
 I feel fine    I feel  fine

The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide.  Mount St. Edelite.
Leonard Bernstein.  Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs.
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!  You symbiotic, patriotic,
slam, but neck, right?  Right.

It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine...fine...

Lyrics:

When I lay myself to sleep pray that I don't go to deep
Lightning won
Because it's cold down cold down there crow

Flat lands low lands on the track
Shows the water pan the track
Lightning won lightning won
Close up hands to silhouette crow

Tambark on the track
Ham crow hold onto your hat
Lightning won lightning won
Low lands timberlands bad lands bird lands




   KING OF BIRDS


       Intro :  D

       D
       A thumbnail sketch, a jeweler's stone
       A mean idea to call my own
       Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young
       There's time to teach, point to point
       Point observation, children carry reservations
                             G
       Standing on the shoulders of giants, leaves me cold
       F#m                           A                        D
       A mean idea to call my own, a hundred million birds fly


       D
       Singer sing me a given, singer sing me a song
       Standing on the shoulders of giants everybody's looking on
                            G
       Standing on the shoulders of giants leaves me cold
       F#m                           A                         B
       A mean idea to call my own, a hundred million birds fly away
       E         B                        E         -->  D
       away... awaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyieeeeeee

         (this part sung 'on top of' the  2nd line in the 2nd verse)
         There's time to teach point to point
         Point observation children carry reservations


       D
       I am king of all I see my kingdom for a voice
       Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young
       Old man don't lay so still you're not yet young
       There's time to teach, point to point
       Point observation, children carry reservations
                             G
       Standing on the shoulders of giants, leaves me cold
       F#m                           A                     D
       A mean idea to call my own, a hundred million birds fly

Play the "D" chord like this:
----5---
----3---
----2---
----0---
--------
--------

And play around with it, like descending on that high E string (frets->5,3,2)
through one line of verse.  You'll hear it.

Where Peewee sits to prove a sage to teach
Peewee gathered up his proof
Reached up and scratched his head
Fell down and hit the ground again

Why do the heathens rage behind the firehouse
Where Peewee sits upon the wall to preach
This boy and girl they gather pearls
Of wisdom falling from his mouth
Wash off the blood wash off the rum
Wash off the blood wash off the 151
