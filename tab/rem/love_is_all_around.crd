R.E.M. didn't write this, someone in the Troggs did, I think...

_Love is All Around_
 

D               Em
I feel it in my fingers
G               A
I feel it in my toes
Love is All Around Me
And so the felling grows
It's written on(in?) the wind
It's everywhere I go
So if you really love me
come on and let it show

Em                     G
You know I love you I always will
Em                       D
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
Em                            G
There's no beginning there'll be no end
                     A
Cause on my love you can depend


I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinkin
of all the things we said
You gave your promise to me
And I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me
In everything I do
