[Riff]
I'm looking for an interruption,
do you believe?
You looking, did my dreams
Be prepared for anything
You come into my little thing
Hooray hooray hip hip hooray
There's one thing I can guarantee:
You won't have to dig, dig too deep

G   Em
Said make me lay, touch me deep,
G  Em
I don't sleep, I dream
G  Em                               G  Em
I'd settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

[Riff]
Are you looking inside my dreams?
You here to run my screens?
You come, deliver my demons
Hooray hooray hip hip hooray
Are you coming to ease my headache?
Do you give good head?
Am I good in bed?

G Em
I don't know, I guess so
G Em
I don't sleep, I dream
G  Em                               G   Em
I'd settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

[Riff]
I'm looking for an interruption,
can you believe?
Some medicine for my headache
Hooray hooray hip hip hooray
I'm itching for a new direction
Catch me when I leave
Don't tell me my dreams are fake

G  Em
you have me lay, you touch me deep,
G Em
I don't sleep, I dream
G  Em                               G  Em
I'd settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

G  Em
You came laid, touch me deep,
G  Em
I don't sleep, I dream
G  Em                               G   Em
I'd settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

If you were a poor Indian with no weapons, and a bunch of
conquistadors came up to you and asked where the gold was, I don't
think it would be a good idea to say, "I swallowed it. So sue me."
