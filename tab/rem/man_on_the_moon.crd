Here's the quick version: Verses are C-D-C-C, then changing to Am-G (throw
pinkie on the A note=5th fret 1st string), resolve to D.
CHORUS: G-Am-C-G-Am-D, G-Am-C-Am.

Hope that helps ya get started.

Jim!

Ok, here is the song as close as I can get it. If you are familiar with
REM and this album specifically, you will have to compensate for the
fact that some of the lyrics incoherent. I'll just put in lala's where
I don't know the words. If you like and listen to the song as much as I
do, you should have no problem.

1ST VERSE:(all chords arpeggiated)

La la la la la in the:game of life. : Yea yea yea yea.

C                     Dsus2           C

Andy Kaufman in a:wrestling match. :  Yea yea yea yea.

C                 Dsus2               C

All of the verses follow the same pattern, except as the song goes on
the chords are more and more strummed.

CHORUS

Andy did you hear about:this one. :Tell me are you locked in the :punch.

Am                      G          Am                             G

Andy are you goofin on:Elvis, hey  :baby. :Are we losing touch?

Am                     G            C      D

If you :believe :they put a :man on the :moon :(Man on the :moon).

G       Am       C           D           G      Am          D

If you :believe :there's :nothing up their :sleeves, and nothin is cool.

G       Am       C        D                 Am

The solo goes something like this:

------12---|-----------|------12---|-----------|------12---|--------
12-12----12|-----------|12-12----12|-----------|12-12----12|--------
-----------|---11-12-11|-----------|---11-12-11|-----------|---11-12
-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------
-----------|12---------|-----------|12---------|-----------|12------
-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------

This is not a perfect tab of the solo because, for one, he uses a slide,
and for two, I am not sitting here with a guitar, I am relying on
memory, and my memory sucks. There are a  few notes probably missing
>from the solo transcription, and I never really played the rhythm part
during  the solo but I think it's probably Am to D.

Other than that I think it's pretty accurate. I could be wrong tho.
