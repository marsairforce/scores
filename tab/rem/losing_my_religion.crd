LOSING MY RELIGION / REM

F Am F  Am

G   Am           
Oh, Life is bigger
Em
It's bigger than you
            Am
And you are not me
                          Em
The lengths that I will go to
                       Am
The distance in your eyes
Em              Em?     Dm
Oh no I've said too much
         G
I set it up

That's me in the corner                                 | %
That's me in the spotlight                              |
Losing my religion                                      |
Trying to keep up with you                              |
And I don't know if I can do it                         |
Oh no I've said too much                                |
I haven't said enough                                   |
                           F                            |
I thought that I heard you laughing                     |
                 F/G     Am/C  Am/D Am/E                |
I thought that I heard you sing                         |
F                         Am     G                      |
I think I thought I saw you try                         |

Every whisper
Of every waking hour I'm
Choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this, consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

% repeat

F
That was just a dream
Am
Try, cry why try
F
That was just a dream
G Am            G       Am
Just a dream... dream

Em? : 000120
