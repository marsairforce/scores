INTRO:  D   G   D   G   D

When your day is long and the night, the night is yours alone
                     G              D                      G    D

When you're sure you've had enough of this life, well hang on
                             G                  D           G  

E(low)---3---2---0--

Don't let yourself go, cause everybody cries and everybody hurts sometimes
E                  A  E                A    E              A               D  G

 
Sometimes everything is wrong,   now it's time to sing along
                              D G 		             D

When your day is night alone             (hold on, hold on)
                              G                   D 

If you feel like letting go              (hold on)
                             G                    D

If you think you've had too much of this life, well hang on
                            G                 D             G
 
E(low)---3---2---0--

Cause everybody hurts, take comfort in your friends
E               A     E                     A       E

Everybody hurts, don't throw your hands, oh now, don't throw your hands
	  A     E	          A         E                     A     C

If you feel like you're alone, no, no, no, you're not alone
                        D4  || C                      A     D

When you think you've had too much, with this life, to hang on
                              G                    D            G

              D     G                    D        G        D

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on,
