Take a closer look next time; as you said yourself, it's on the Automatic...
album, so check this one out for other songs of the album when you keep the
line to nevada busy. Well, here it is (from that file) anyway;


"MONTY GOT A RAW DEAL"
 
(Capo 3rd fret)

Intro: Em G Em G Em G D C Em

Em               G                 Em              G
Monty this seems strange to me, the movies had that movie thing
Em                 G                D     C          Em
But nonsense has a welcome ring and heros don't come easy
 
Em                 G          Em              G
Now nonsense isn't new to me, I know my head I know my feet
Em                      G                D   C   Em  D    C   Em
But mischief knocked me in the knees so just let go, just let go
 
Em              G             Em               G
I saw the ocean meet the man, I saw you buried in the sand
Em                    G                D    C  Em
A friend was there to hold my hand, so walk on by
 
Em                G                   Em                  G
So I went walking through the stream, I saw you strung up in a tree
Em                G                D    C    Em      D    C    Em
A woman out there said to me, said hold your tongue, hold your tongue
 
G         D      C   Em    G         D         C   Em
you Don't owe me anything, you don't want this sympathy [waste your breath]
G         D          C                          D       C      Em
Don't you waste your breath [waste your breath] for the silver screen
 
Em                    G             Em                     G
That nonsense doesn't mean a thing, they tried to bust you in a sting
Em               G             D     C     Em
But virtue isn't everything so don't waste time
 
Em                      G              Em               G
Now Here's a rhyme that you must hear, put this on your reel to reel
Em                 G            D       C      Em   D     C      Em
Mischief through a rotten deal, Monty's laying low, he is laying low
D    C   Em  D    C   Em
Just let go, just let go
 
G         D      C   Em    G         D         C   Em
you Don't owe me anything, you don't want this sympathy [waste your breath]
G         D          C                          G          D     C       Em
Don't you waste your breath [waste your breath] Monty this seems strange to me
