                                                    [Also, in the "These Words"
                                                    part, use barre chords.]

[C Am]
I don't know why you're mean to me
when I call on the telephone
I don't know what you mean to me
but I want to turn you on, turn you up, figure you out, I wanna take you home


C     Gm  F C   F            G
These words,    "You will be mine"
C     Gm  F C   F            G     F       G
These words,    "You will be mine, all the time"

(Fill)

[C Am]
The Fool might be my middle name
But I'd be foolish not to say
Gonna make whatever it takes,
ring you up, call you down, sign your name, secret love
To finally take you with and make you mine

C     Gm  F C   F            G
These words,    "You will be mine"
C     Gm  F C   F            G     F       G
These words,    "You will be mine, all the time, oh"

Am            G     Am        G
I tripped and fell, but did I fall?
Am                 G     Am                G
What I want you to feel, I want to feel it now
[C Am]
We know with love comes strange currencies,
and here is my appeal:

[C Am]
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance,
a word, a signal, not a little breath
just to fool myself, to catch myself, to make it real, real

C     Gm  F C   F            G
These words,    "You will be mine"
C     Gm  F C   F            G     F       G
These words,    "You will be mine, all the time, oh"
C     Gm  F C   F            G
These words,    "You will be mine"
C     Gm  F C   F                                                    G
These words,    call me, cut me down, catching my throat, make me pay,
F          G
say love's combined, oh

C Gm F C   F   G
C Gm F C   F   G    F   G

End on a C chord

To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kinda scary. I guess it
goes back to the time we went to the circus and a clown killed my Dad.

The chords for the verses - just add your pinkie to the first string
(3rd fret) for the added G note.
