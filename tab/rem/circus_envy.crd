Here comes that awful feeling again
Welcoming of the animal
I hold my breath, do what you say,
_____ acrobat, ball and chain,
'm not afraid, I messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up

A
I've got my telescope
G
head in the haystack
A                         G
I'm getting tired of your dodgeball circus act
A
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark
NC
on command

[Riff]
Here comes that awful feeling again
Make way for monster jealousy
The strong man kicked sand in my breakfast cereal bowl
I'd spelled your name with Oatios,
he messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up

A
I've got my telescope
G
head in the haystack
A                         G
I'm getting tired of your dodgeball circus act
A
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark
NC
on command

Bridge:   D   F   G   A   (x 4)

[Riff]
If I were you I'd really run from me
I really really wish that I were you
I'd give this a crunchy
and drop a load on your head
This monster in me makes me wish you'd messed it, messed it up

A
I've got my telescope
G
head in the haystack
A                         G
I'm getting tired of your dodgeball circus act
A                        G
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark
A                        G
Put pepper in my coffee, I forgot to bark
NC
on command

Bridge:   D   F   G   A   (x 4)

{Continue with the D F G A progression over following:}

I smell jealousy
I smell jealousy, jealousy, jealousy

As I bit into the sweet, tangy nectarine, and tasted the juices
running down my chin, I looked down, and realized that it wasn't a
nectarine at all, but a HUMAN HEAD!
