Lyrics:

If you hear this...look again
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a shadow to this boy

A penny on it's side
Write a letter...give a call
Let me know you're alive
And doing well
A quarter past three
The quarter you live in haunts my eyes

I'm hand over head
I'm held over hand
I'm hand over head over heels over you

Write a letter, give a call
Let me know you're alive
And doing well
It's everything for two
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a shadow to this boy

A quarter past three
A quarter past...
The quarter you live in haunts my eyes

I'm hand over head
I'm held over hand
I'm hand over head over heels over you

Write a letter...give a call
Let me know you're alive
And doing well
It's everything for two
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a shadow to this boy

I'll give you a kiss
I'll give you a hug
I'll tell you a secret that's no lie
Don't be a stranger
Don't be a shadow
Don't be a shadow to this boy

Lyrics:

Baby I, don't want to be seen with you
Baby, I got better things to do
Baby, I don't wanna hang around with you
Baby, I got better things to do

Cause I know you're out with other guys
Well I know you're goin' to tell me lies

Baby, I should have held you when I had the chance
Baby I could have blew it when I never learned how to dance

Well I know you're out with other guys
And I know you're gonna tell me lies

I wait at home every night
I never leave on my back porch light
I'm hoping you won't come back
Cause if you do I'll wanna die
Baby, I don't wanna hang around with you

Baby, I got better things to do
Well, I know you're out with other guys
Well, I you're gonna tell me lies

Baby, I should have held you when I had the chance
Baby I blew it when I never learned how to dance
Well, I know you're out with other guys
And I know you're gonna tell me lies

Baby, I....

Lyrics:

All the young kids learn to dance in the combat zone
Never dared to take a chance
Goin' home alone

But it gets so very cold
When it's late at night

Leave the foxholes on their own
Do you sleep well at night?

Bodycount...feeling hot
Bodycount...keeping warm

Friends are playing with danger
They don't know where it's found
With their casual letters
It's just another chain

You've lost the innocence
That you've never found
Standing in the DMZ
Don't get turned around

Body count...feeling hot
Body count...Vietnam

It's not the game..well, it's a scar
And they won't let you wear your khakis
And your eyesights anymore

You can go get shot to hell
They don't want you anymore because..

All the young kids learn to dance
In the combat zone
Never dare to take a chance
You're going home alone
Military metaphors
Are metaphors no more

Keeping up with protocol
You're dancin' off to war

Body count feeling hot
Body count  Vietnam

Do you sleep well at night?

Body Count...Vietnam

They can say what they want
But you have your doubts

It's not what you've lost
It's what your without

When I ran so far
And they just turned away

I doesn't bother me by the light of day
But at night...I hear your call
Late at night...I hear your call

I saw the mirror that you broke today
I saw the ceiling falling down your way

When they looked at you, you could turn away

You didn't bother then by the light of day...you'll stay

But at night...I hear your call
Late at night...I hear your call

You said that you could turn away
I knew that you going to stay

The walls are falling all around
They pinned you down onto the ground
But at night...I hear your call
Vietnam...I hear you call

Lyrics:


These are dangerous times
Nothing to care or die for
These are dangerous times
What you want , someone will buy for you

Don't get away

It's so easy to wait
You've been wearing the green
I've been wearing the fall
And you said that all was just agreed

But, don't get away

I saw a guy out on the street
Said, I know what you need, BOY
I can set you fine
I didn't buy his line, because

These are dangerous times
I don't want to get old
You say that everything's fine
Then you leave me standing in the cold
All alone

But, don't get away

It's so easy to fall
You've been trying to gain
I've been trying to stop
But it's catching up with me again

But, don't get away

These are dangerous times
It's a dangerous time

Lyrics:


I get so disturbed...I'm all alone
I feel so funny t-t-t-talking on the phone

I fall apart when I hear you speak
Believe me girl, I just feel weak

I wonder how I got involved with a girl like...
You want to tell me  that I'm not you're kind of guy
You break the news and I break down and cry...I cry

You're having fun...well that's all right
I'm too weak to put up a fight
I wish you'd just tell what was wrong
instead of leading my on

I get so disturbed when I'm all alone
I feel so funny t-t-t-talking on the phone
I fall apart when I hear your speak
Believe me girl...I just feel weak
I wish you'd just tell me what was wrong
Instead of leading me on

I try to call
(call on the phone)
I try to call
(but nobody's home)
I wonder why
(you lead my along)

I wonder how I got involved with a girl like you

Too...too...took her so long
I was only having fun
I guess I'm really hung
I guess you'd better run

That's what Lisa said

While you running all over town
Why don't you settle down
I told her we were just friends
She believed it till the end

That's what Lisa said
That's what she said

She's a (cherry?) now
She put me on her
She put you on trial
No I'm in her_______

Too...too...Took her so long
I was only having fun
I guess I'm not so hung
I guess you'd better run

That's what Lisa said
That's what she said

Lyrics:

Living in cities, living in cars
Living the way you never wanted to
Living in alleys, living it down
Living the way you always thought you'd do

Shakin' it up shakin' it down
Shakin' the way you never wanted to

Living in cities, living in cars
Living the way you always thought
you'd do

You feel so old, I feel so new
Tell me what you want me to...
Do you want me to go all night
Do you want me to tell you you're all
right

Living in cities, living in cars
Living the way you never wanted to

Lord, I feel so new
Tell me what you want me to do

And it's a mystery to me
And it's a mystery to me

Well your trying, trying to look so hard
But you want..but you want...but you want to go

Living in cities, living in cars
Living the way you never wanted to
Shakin' it up, shaking it down
Shakin' the way you always thought you'd do

You feel so old, I feel so new
Tell me what you want me to do

Lyrics:

Pretty blond hair singing as she walks
China-like smile bitchin' as she talks
Dangerous eyes on a small town girl
Seen everything all around the world

If I could only let her see my way
Maybe we should spin a watch all day
in a place far away from here

repeat

She's such good girl
Got me in a whirl
She's okay

Pretty blond hair singing as she walks
China-like smile bitchin' as she talks
Dangerous eyes on a small town girl
Seen everything all around the world

If I could only let her see my way
Maybe we could spin the watch all day
in a place far away from here

She's such good girl
Got me in a whirl
She's such a pretty girl
She's such good girl
Got me in a whirl
She's okay

Lyrics:


When I was watching TV back in '73
A skinny old man sure appealed to me
His name by now, I'm sure you know
The man who played a starring role in Jacques Cousteau

And ever since then I've written the dude
Dreaming of swimming around the
coral reef
I'd even bought my camera and my scuba gear
If only Jacques had called to stop a career

I wanna be a narrator
For the Jacques Cousteau show

Swimming under water with my microphone
I'd record noises in the aqua-zone
Chasing down the killer whale that's eating our crew
Just to bring the story (facts) back to you

I wanna be a narrator
For the Jacques Cousteau show

I've written the networks, sent my picture too
Done everything I could possibly do
I've given up trying to get through to him
Maybe he knows I don't know how to swim

I wanna be a narrator
For the Jacques Cousteau show

Lyrics:

Gotta get away..gotta get away
I'm on a permanent vacation
Nothing left to move
I want a revelation
Nothing left to prove

I could take it with me
Leave you all behind
Got some kind of feeling
Burnin' on my mind

Sleeping late in the morning
Stay out all night long
Every day is like the one before
I'm going wrong

I'm on a permanent vacation
Nothing left to lose
I want a revelation
Nothing left to prove

I can take it with me
Leave you all behind
Got some kind of feeling
Burnin on my mind

There's only one thing you can do
This I gotta do
_______________
I got nothing to win...nothing to lose
Nothing left to prove
One thing to do

Well, I'm on a permanent vacation
Permanent vacation

Lyrics:

A public service announcement followed me home the other day,
I bade it nevermind, go away.
The shit's so thick, you could stir it with a stick,
the paper wouldn't lie, wisdom got lost to mankind, we gloat and jeer with it

Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord,
count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, well you can't send us, listen,

Radio no, play the game, three words, first one short,
magazine, book, cinema, N - O - down,
many fears are gone, step down, step down,
watch a heel crush,  ah this means war

I saw the light, it can't be right

Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord,
count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, well you can't send us,

It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture,
It's been a bad day, please
It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture,
It's been a bad day, please

A public service announcement followed me home the other day,
I bade it nevermind,
The shit's so thick, you could stir it with a stick,
the paper wouldn't lie, wisdom got lost to mankind, we gloat and jeer with it

Broadcast me a joyful noise into the times, Lord,
count your blessings, ignore the lowest fear, come one, what more?

It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture,
It's been a bad day, please
It's been a bad day, please don't take my picture,
It's been a bad day, please

Lyrics:


You say you make her feel all right
She says she wants you, but not tonight
You know the girl is telling lies
You try some magic in her eye

When you not there other guys come sticking around
And when you ask her what's going on
She'll only push you around

Say you don't want to talk about it
She'll tell you stories...she can bet

You know the girl ...she's telling lies
You try some magic in her eyes

But when you're not there other guys come sticking around
When you ask her what's going on
She'll only push you around
Put you down

You can say what you want
but she's SHEHERAZADE
And you don't mind
And you call when she calls
You pay the price
You're bound to fall
And all the lies don't matter at all

You say you don't want to talk about it
She'll tell you stories
You can die
You know the girl is telling lies
You try some magic in her eye

But when you're not there other guys come sticking around
And when you ask her what's going on
She'll only push you around
Put you down

You can say what you want
She's SHEHERAZADE

Lyrics:


I saw the shoals at night, with the moon above.
I felt an obligation, and heard your voice again.
If you were here once, you were here a hundred times.
If I reached out tonight, I found I couldn't fight it.
If you were here once, you were here a hundred times.
Ohhhhhh

Best as a wishing star, I saw you better far away,
and I felt obligation, and heard your voice again.
Hear the rush of water, passing over the shoals.
Hear my heartbeat rather, if I reached out tonight.
If I reach out tonight and find I can't fight it,
and look to the stars, and wander towards a

heartfelt obligation, a place that you called home
and heard your voice again, but it's too late.
You left long ago, and now you're probably dead and gone,
and I'm left here with the water and the shoals and a tainted obligation.
Ohhhhhh

Lyrics:

You got your problems darling
I got mine too
You know that
maybe it's time for you to come through
Because I'm fed up with waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast
what are you gonna do?

I've almost given up hope
then what else is new?
You know that
I'm at the end of my rope trying to hang on to you
Because my patience is wearing thin just waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast
what are you gonna do

You better wait (WAIT!)
Don't go away now darling, wait (WAIT)
Why don't you stay?
You better wait (WAIT!)
Don't go away now, wait (WAIT!)
Why don't you stay?

I know that you're confused
it's no crime
You better hurry Sugar
cuz we're running out of time
Because my patience is wearing thin just waiting for you
Won't you decide real fast
what are you gonna do?

chorus

I don't wanna walk on the same stage with you
Then the bells begin to blow in my head
If things don't turn out right
It's gonna be all right
