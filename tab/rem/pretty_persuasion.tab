He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
Goddamn your confusion
She's got pretty persuasion

It's not what i want
Oh realize
All has been tried
No reasoning----

And I put that in this heat it's all wrong
Try to wear that on my sleeve it's all wrong all wrong

Chorus
He's got a pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
Goddamn your confusion
He's got pretty persuasion

In the light I want
I will see you again???

It's not what I want
I realize
All has been tried
Follow easily ________

Try to put that in this heat it's all wrong
Cannot wear that on your sleeve it's all wrong it's all wrong

Chorus
End on F#m

This should be a close approximation.  There are two guitars in parts, one
possibly a 12 string.  Corrections/Additions welcome, especially on the
lyrics.  I transcribed this in response to a recent request, would like to see
more REM from 1st two albums.
FWIW, I transcribed the intro riff using a MIDI guitar into Finale using the
Hyperscribe feature.  The ability to slow down the tapping of the beat helped
compensate for the MIDI guitar delay.  I then used Finale's tablature feature
to build the tab.  It worked pretty well.
