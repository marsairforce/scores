 I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change.
                                                  A7
 Though all the feelings that broke through that door
 just didn't seem to be too real.
  D                            C
 The yard is nothing but a fence, the sun just hurts my eyes.
        G                            A7                                   D
Somewhere it must be time for penitence.  Gardening at night is never where.
  G   A         D      G    A        D     G     A        D
Gardening at night.  Gardening at night.  Gardening at night.

 We ankled up the garbage sound, but they were busy in the rows.

 We fell up, not to see the sun, gardening at night just didn't grow.

{same as before}

I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change.
Though all the feelings that broke through that door
just didn't seem to be too real.
Gardening at night.  Gardening at night.  Gardening at night

Your sister said that you're too young.
They should know they've been there twice.
The call was 2 and 51.
They said it couldn't be arranged.

I see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change.
Though all the feelings that broke through that door
just didn't seem to be too real.
We ankled up the garbage sound, but they were busy in the rows.
We fell up not to see the sun, gardening at night just didn't grow.
Gardening at night.  Gardening at night.  Gardening at night

It was round about midnight. Hipster town.
Imagine going for a walk.
Things get around to taking place. It's not a waste of time.
The rich got a little poorer.
Things get around to taking place. If they're gonna happen at all.
Don't need that jazz. Don't need that stuff.
It was round about midnight. Hipster town.
It was round about midnight. Hipster town.

(Repeat 1st verse)
