This is my first post, I don't have a clue what am doing, so bear with me.
I play an acoustic, and don't really have a very good ear for _actual_ chords.
so this is a version that I like.  You can play along with the record, or play
alone.  Of course, you may not be playing what Peter Buck played, but it is fun
anyway.  And don't laugh at my ignorance of chord names, you smart alecks
(grin).  And especially don't laugh at the "lyrics" here since they are not my
doing.  You will have to listen to the record for the rhythms.  Any questions
queries qualms or quandries should be directed to me.  Gripes, too.

Hard to be what you can be jump down junk in your energy
Hard to walk in dignity with throw-up on your shoes
They can't supply the oil, 1979
Calculate the capital, one for the public, ask any ask TV tells a million 
lies that they twist down by the report anything that isn't handed 
on a presidential spoon
