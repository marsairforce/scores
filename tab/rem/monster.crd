I'm looking for an interruption,
do you believe?
You looking, did my dreams
Be prepared for anything
You come into my little scene
Hooray hooray hip hip hooray
There's one thing I can guarantee:
You won't have to dig, dig too deep

G   Em
Said leave me to lay, but touch me deep,
G  Em
I don't sleep, I dream
G  Em                               G  Em
I'll settle for a cup of coffee, but you know what I really need

[Riff]
Are you looking to drive my dreams?
You here to run my screens?
You come, deliver my demons
Hooray hooray hip hip hooray
Are you coming to ease my headache?
Do you give good head?
Am I good in bed?

G Em
I don't know, I guess so
G Em
I don't sleep, I dream

You know with love come strange currencies
[Pattern 2]
And here is my appeal:
[Pattern 1]
I need a chance, a second chance, a third chance, a fourth chance,
a word, a signal, a nod, a little breath
[Pattern 2]
just to fool myself, catch myself, to make it real, real

Here comes that awful feeling again
Welcome the ugly animal.
I hold my breath to what you sing,
My pyro b-ba-ba ball and chain,
I'm not afraid, I messed it, messed it, messed it, messed it up

   YOU

>From Bryan Killingsworth (akilling@pen.k12.va.us):

'You' off Monster is Dm, Gm for the verse and it holds Am
for awhile and goes to C for the chorus (I think)...with a Dm
riff during the verses (the notes are pretty much in the chord,
hammer-on on the 2nd fret of G string and open D string).



Let the sun beat through the clouds,
Let me kiss you on the mouth.
All my childhood toys with chew marks in from a smile.
Let me hold your syrup close to mine.
Let me watch you, Hollywood and Vine.
And I want you like the movies, touch me now.
I love you crazy, just keep on.
I love you madly, just keep watch.
You wipe my lips,
You turn me on.
My attentions are turned to you.

Did I dream you were a tourist
in the Arizona sun?
I can see you there with luna moths
and watermelon gum.
I woke up in the sleeping bag,
With nowhere else to run.
You're standing in the bathroom
telling me its all in fun.
I love you crazy, just keep on.
I love you madly, just keep watch.
You wipe my lips,
You turn me on.
My attentions are turned to you.

I can whisper in your ear.
I can write a calendar year
I can wing around your Saturn smile, shut out the moon
I walked the tension wire line.
And I learned to disrespect the signs.
And I want you like a Pisces rising, even though
I love you crazy, just keep on.
I love you madly, just keep watch.
You wipe my lips,
You turn me on.
My attentions are turned to you.
