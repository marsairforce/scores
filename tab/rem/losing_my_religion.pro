{title:Losing my Religion}
{subtitle:R.E.M.}
[Dm](intro) [Am]         [Dm]         [G]
[G]Oh, [Am]life it's bigger, [Em]it's bigger that you and you are [Am]not me 
The lengths that I will [Em]go to, the distance in your [Am]eyes
[Em]Oh no I've said too [Dm]much, I've said it [G]all

{start_of_chorus}
That's me in the [Am]corner, that's me in the [Em]spotlight, losing my [Am]religion
Trying to [Em]keep up with you and I [Am]don't know if I can do it [Em]
Oh no I've said too [Dm]much, I haven't said [G]enough
I thought that I heard you [F]laughing, I thought that I heard you [Am]sing
I [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw you [Am]try
{end_of_chorus}

Every whisper of every waking hour, I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you like a hurt lost and blinded foal, oh
Oh no I've said too much, I said it all
Consider this, consider this, a hint of the century, 
Consider this, a slip that brought me to my knees, pale
What if all these fantasies come flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you [F]laughing, I thought that I heard you [Am]sing
I [F]think I thought I [Dm]saw you [Am]try
But [Am]That was just a dream, [C]That was just a [G]dream

{comment:chorus}
But That was just a dream, try, cry, fly, and try
That was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream, dream
