   REM: LIFE'S RICH PAGEANT

   BEGIN THE BEGIN


{lick      G(3) :  ------------0-2-0----
           D(2) :  --0-h-2-h-4-------4-0-  F# chord....}

F#                      A
Birdie in the hand for life's rich demand
       E                     F#       {lick}
The insurgency began and you missed it
F#                     A
I looked for it and I found it
                E                  F#    F#7
Miles Standish proud, congratulate me

     D
A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe

{same as before}
Life's rich demand creates supply in the hand
Of the powers, the only vote that matters
Silence means security silence means approval
On Zenith, on the TV, tiger run around the tree
Follow the leader, run and turn into butter

D
Let's begin again, begin the begin
F#                       A
Let's begin again like Martin Luther Zen
      E               F#           {lick}
The mythology begins the begin
F#
Answer me a question I can't itemize
                 A
I can't think clearly, look to me for reason
                             E                  F#   F#7
It's not there, I can't even rhyme in the begin

     D
A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
F                             G {keys walkdown}   C#
Example: the finest example is you

Birdie in the hand for life's rich demand
The insurgency began and you missed it
I looked for it and I found it
Miles Standish proud, congratulate me

     D
A philanderer's tie, a murderer's shoe
F            G      F        G
Let's begin again begin the begin
F           G     F      G
Let's begin again

I wish to meet each one of you
And you, me, you, if I can and I can
We have many things in common, name three

I had a hat and it sunk, reached down,
yanked it up, slapped it on my head
All the people gather
Fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years we are concern
We are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go.

Now I'm not feeding off you I will rearrange your scales
If I can and I can
I wish to meet each one of you and you, me, you

I had a hat and it sunk, reached down,
yanked it up, slapped it on my head
All the people gather
Fly to carry each his burden
We are young despite the years we are concern
We are hope despite the times
All of the sudden, these days
Happy throngs, take this joy wherever, wherever you go.

In the final act of the beginning of time.

The town is safe again tonight

The bigger the weapon the greater the fear
Hyena is ambassador to here

Night time fell like the closing
Meager pay, but recognition
Hyena crawls on his belly out
The town is safe again tonight

   JUST A TOUCH


From: Richard Hall

It's A and G over and over in righteous groove, then switch to C#m and A
for the chorus.  The bridge is E and D, but then the G comes back in.  I
usually fudge through this part or leave it out altogether.  It's such a
cruddy bridge in an otherwise exhilarating strum.


Lyrics:

Well what in the world?  Women in black
Don't you remember send us back
A day in the life well nobody laughed
Look to the days how long can this last

Kevin heard it on the radio
Hugh informed word of mouth
Carla read it in the news
Caught it all just a touch

You set the pace of what was to come
I have to carry on now that you're gone
A day in the life well nobody laughed
Look to the days how long can this last

There's someone in our dreams
In our preassembled dream

Well what in the world?  Women in black
Don't you remember send us back
A day in the life well nobody laughed
Look to the days how long can this last

I can't see where to worship Popeye, love Al Green,
I can't see, I'm so young, I'm so god damn young

My spirit, I will not tell

You're on your honor not to tell

You're on your honor, on your honor

When I was young and give and take

When I was young and fever fell
My spirit I will not tell
You're on your honor on your honor

Trust in your calling, make sure your calling's true
Think of others, the others think of you
Silly rule golden words make, practice practice makes perfect,
Perfect is a fault, in fault lies change

I believe my humor's wearing thin
And change is what I believe in

{break  C#m    A     C#m    A      C#  A    B}

I believe my shirt is wearing thin
And change is what I believe in

When I was young and full of grace
As spirited a rattlesnake
When I was young and fever fell
My spirit, I will not tell
You're on your honor not to tell
 B
I believe in example
 G#m
I believe my throat hurts
   A                           B
Example is the checker to the key

I believe my humor's wearing thin
And I believe the poles are shifting

I believe my shirt is wearing thin
And change is what I believe in

End on C#m.




   THE FLOWERS OF GUATEMALA


(intro:  E  A) [Barre Chords]

(verse)
              E                      A
I took a picture that I'll have to send
             E                        A
People here are friendly and content

                    E                      A
The flowers often bloom at night

The flowers cover everything
                  D                 C      G   A
The flowers cover everything

There's something that I've never seen before
Amanita is the name they cover over everything

Wait for dawn and dawn shall come
Underneath the bunkers in the row





   CUYAHOGA (Version 1)



There are two ways to play the intro riff.  The more accurate way is to tune
your low E string down to D.  If you want to be able to play normal chord
shapes, though, this way is better:

G(3) --2------2----|
D(4) 0-----0-----0-|
              A(5) |--5-----5-5-----|--2-------2-----|--5-5---5-5-----|
              E(6) |3-----3-----3---|0-----0-------0-|3-----3-----3---|

      D                 G         Em          G    (repeat throughout verse)
Let's put our heads together and start a new country up
Our father's father's father tried, erased the parts he didn't like
Let's try to fill it in, bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red

Em               Bm      Em               F#m
This is where we walked, this is where we swam
Em               Bm  Em           D
Take a picture here, take a souvenir

      D                 G         Em          G    (repeat throughout verse)
This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it
We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red
And we gathered up our friends, bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me, underneath the river bed

(see below...)
This is where we walked, this is where we swam
Take a picture here, take a souvenir

Cuyahoga           D - Em -/G - Bm -/D D D D/ Asus4 A A2 A
Cuyahoga, gone     D - Em -/G - Bm -/D - Em -/G - - -

      D                 G         Em          G    (repeat throughout verse)
Let's put our heads together, start a new country up,
Underneath the river bed we burned the river down.
This is where they walked, swam, hunted, danced and sang,
Take a picture here, take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone

Bm              F#m               G
Rewrite the book and rule the pages, saving face, secured in faith
Bm               F#m    G
Bury, burn the waste behind you

(intro riff)

      D                 G         Em          G    (repeat throughout verse)
This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it
We are not your allies, we can not defend
This is where they walked, this is where they swam
Take a picture here, take a souvenir

Cuyahoga           D - Em -/G - Bm -/D D D D/ Asus4 A A2 A
Cuyahoga, gone     D - Em -/G - Bm -/D - Em -/G - - -
Cuyahoga           D - Em -/G - Bm -/D D D D/ Asus4 A A2 A
Cuyahoga, gone     D - Em -/G - Bm -/D - Em -/G - - -


This is what to do for the "this is where we walked..." part:

     Em               Bm                Em               F#m

Lyrics:

Let's put our heads together and start a new country up
Our father's father's father tried, erased the parts he didn't like
Let's try to fill it in, bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red

This is where we walked, this is where we swam
Take a picture here, take a souvenir

This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it
We knee-skinned it you and me, we knee-skinned that river red
And we gathered up our friends, bank the quarry river, swim
We knee-skinned it you and me, underneath the river bed

This is where we walked, this is where we swam
Take a picture here, take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone

Let's put our heads together, start a new country up,
Underneath the river bed we burned the river down.
This is where they walked, swam, hunted, danced and sang,
Take a picture here, take a souvenir
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone

Rewrite the book and rule the pages, saving face, secured in faith
Bury, burn the waste behind you

This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it
We are not your allies, we can not defend
This is where they walked, this is where they swam
Take a picture here, take a souvenir

Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone
Cuyahoga
Cuyahoga, gone




   WHAT IF WE GIVE IT AWAY?


Chords by: Tony Bowden (dejavu@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk)


G       A      G              A
On the outside underneath the wall
All the money couldn't buy
You're mistaken no one's standing there
For the record no one tried

C     Bm        C    Bm
Oh... I.....   try to
G                   D
What if we give it away...?

Overlooking with a hollow eye
What's pretending is it right
Eye for order a hand for what's in line
Couldn't follow couldn't write

A        D        C    G
And our life does fine here
A         D       C   Em
Stitch it on your tie here

Here's the trailer Tom
A year has come and gone
We're not moving was it right
Take the order sew it on your tie
We couldn't follow couldn't try

 (A)-3------------3-------

 Dm                Am
There's a problem, feathers iron
 Dm                Am
Bargain buildings, weights and pullies
 Dm                Am                Dm                  Am
Feathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air
 Dm       G       C       Am       Dm               G7
Buy the sky and sell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky

{it sounds good to walk up to the C chord like this:}
(A) ---0-2- C chord
(E) -3----


{walk}    C   Dm     F    G
  Don't fall      on me (What is it up in the air for) (It's gonna fall)
        Fall      on me (If it's there for long) (It's gonna fall)
                                 F        G   F  Fmaj7

        Fall      on me (It's over it's over me) (It's gonna fall)


{same as before}
There's the progress we have found       (when the rain)
A way to talk around the problem         (when the children reign)
Building towered foresight               (keep your conscience in the dark)
isn't anything at all                    (the statues in the park)
Buy the sky and sell the sky and bleed the sky and tell the sky

(repeat chorus)
Don't fall on me

 Am           F
Well I could keep it above
 Am            G                     Am
But then it wouldn't be sky anymore
  F                              Dm               G
So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it home

 Dm      G       C        Am      Dm         G      C      Am
Buy the sky and sell the sky and lift your arms up to the sky
     Dm              G
And ask the sky and ask the sky

(repeat chorus, etc.)




   SWAN SWAN HUMMINGBIRD


The Rhythm guitar is played on a 12 - string while the other part is
played on a regular 6 - string.

  This song is in 6/8 time. In the intro, Peter plays an Am chord. On
beat four, he lifts up his finger on the second fret of the D string
then hammers it right back on. Its an old trick but one of my
favorites.  He also does it on the Dm chord when it's played for a
whole 6 beats - except of course, he lifts his finger off of the G
string.


Am          Dm           G
Swan, swan, hummingbird
   Am              Dm
Hurrah, we are all free now
      Am               Dm    G
What noisy cats are we
         Am                   Dm
Girl and dog he bore his cross
   Am       Dm    G   Am
A long, low time ago, people talk to me

Em                     F
Johnny Reb what's the price of fans
Em                F
Forty a piece or three for one dollar?
      Em              F
Hey captain don't you want to buy
     Em              C    G
Some bone chains and toothpicks?

{same as first verse}
Night wings, her hair chains,
Here's your wooden greenback, sing
Wooden beams and dovetail sweep
I struck that picture ninety times,
I walked that path a hundred ninety,
Long, low time ago, people talk to me

   G         Bm
A pistol hot cup of rhyme
    C                     D
The whiskey is water, the water is wine
G                Bm                   C             C/B
Marching feet, Johnny Reb, what's the price of heroes?

Six and one half dozen the other,
Tell that to the captain's mother,
Hey captain don't you want to buy,
Some bone chains and toothpicks?

Night wings, her hair chains
Swan, swan, hummingbird
Hurrah, we are all free now
What noisy cats are we
Long, low time ago, people talk to me
A pistol hot cup of rhyme,

{end on Am}

The whiskey is water, the water is wine

I have to laugh, because what *is* that thing?
