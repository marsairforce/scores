REM

SWEETNESS FOLLOWS (From the album "Automatic for the People")
-----------------
 
INTRO:  D

Readying to bury your father and your mother
D                            D2

What did you think when you lost another
D                           D2

I used to wonder why did you bother
D                    D2

Distance from one, one to the other
D                      D2
 
 (Rest of song continues the same way unless otherwise noted)

Listen here my sister and my brother
What would you care if you lost the other
I always wondered why did we bother
Distance from one, one to the other
Oh, oh, oh, oh sweetness follows
Bb  C   Bb  C               D     D
 
It's these little things, they can pull you under
Live your life filled with joy and wonder
I always knew this all together with thunder
It's lost to now or never lives
Oh, oh, oh, oh sweetness follows
Oh, oh, oh, oh sweetness follows
 
It's these little things, they can pull you under
Live your life filled with joy and thunder
Yea, yea we were all together
Lost to now or never lives
Oh, oh, oh, oh sweetness follows
Oh, oh, oh, oh sweetness follows
