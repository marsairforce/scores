B -----0--0----0--0----0--0----0--0--0-0-0-0-0-------------------

(play 2x)

A                             D   E
Beside yourself if radio's gonna stay.
A                          D   E
Reason: it could polish up the grey.
A                               D     E
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
A                       D   E
That this isn't country at all

F#    A      (EEAE)    F#    A         B
Raving station,       beside yourself

{same as verse above}
Keep me out of country in the word
Deal the porch is leading us absurd.
Push that, push that, push that to the hull
That this isn't nothing at all.

Straight off the boat, where to go?

E           A          E              A
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
E     A                E       A
Radio Free Europe

Beside defying media too fast
Instead of pushing palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that before all
That this isn't fortunate at all

Raving station, beside yourself
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
Radio Free Europe, radio.

Bsus4   C#                  Bsus4            C#
Decide yourself, calling all of the medias too fast

Keep me out of country in the word
Disappoint is into us absurd

Straight off the boat, where to go?
Calling on in transit, calling on in transit
Radio Free Europe



   PILGRIMAGE


{piano intro is something like this:}
(D) ---3-------------------
(A) -----3------3----------
(E) --------3-------------- .... repeat then go on to verses...

Take a turn, take a turn
Take our fortune, take our fortune

(G)  -------0---------0------------------
(D)  ----3---------3----------0-------0--
(A)  --1--------1-----------3-------3----
(E)  ---------------------1-------1------   ... repeat several times

They called the clip a two-headed cow
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck, pilgrimage
Rest assured this will not last, take a turn for the worst
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck a two-headed cow

CCC    F         G
   The pilgrimage has gained momentum
F      G
Take a turn, take a turn
F        G        F        G
Take our fortune, take our fortune
Pilgrimage

{the little break is....}
C / / /  C(Bbass) / / /  Bb / / / G {of course repeated some}

Speakin' in tongues, it's worth a broken lip
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck, pilgrimage
Rest assured this will not last, take a turn for the worst
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck a two-headed cow
The pilgrimage has gained momentum
Take a turn, take a turn
Take our fortune, take our fortune

Pilgrimage.  Pilgrimage.

Speakin' in tongues, it's worth a broken lip
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck
Rest assured this will not last, take a turn for the worst
Your hate clipped and distant, your luck two-headed
The pilgrimage has gained momentum
Take a turn, take a turn
Take our fortune, take our fortune

Pilgrimage.  Pilgrimage.
The pilgrimage has gained momentum
Take a turn, take a turn
Take our fortune, take our fortune
Take a turn, take a turn
Take our fortune, take our fortune




   LAUGHING


C#m                 E
Laocoon and her two sons
C#m                       E
Pressured storm, tried to move
C#m                    E
No other more, emotion bound
C#m          E
Martyred, misconstrued

A    E    C#m  A    E  C#m  C#m B   E Esus E
Ligh-ted       in a room    la--nky room
F#m   G#m F#m   G#m F#m G#m Esus E       A E
Ligh--ted ligh--ted laughing     in tune
Lighted lighted laughing

Laocoon and her two sons
Run the gamut, sated view
Know them more, emotion bound
Martyred, misconstrued

A    E    C#m  A    E  C#m  C#m B   E Esus E
Ligh-ted       in a room    la--nky room
F#m   G#m F#m   G#m F#m G#m Esus E       A E
Ligh--ted ligh--ted laughing     in tune
Lighted lighted laughing

G#m  E      E----4-5-7-5-4-----
In a room   B--5-----------5-9-
         C#m            E      E----4-5-7-5-4---
lock the door latch the room   B--5-----------5-
Lighted, lighted, laughing

Laocoon and her two sons
Ran the gamut, settled new,
Find a place fit to laugh,
Lock the doors, latch the room
Lighted in a room, lanky room
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tunes
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tunes


Note:  the F#m and G#m are arpeggiated barre forms
with high B and E strings open (i.e. XX4200 and XX6400)



   TALK ABOUT THE PASSION


All verses start with this riff (repeated twice):
E----------------------------------------------------------------------
B-----------------------------3-------------3-2-0----------------------
G-2-2-------2-2-------------0---0---------0-------2--------------------
D-0-0-0-2-4-0-0-0-2-4-0---2-------2-----2------------------------------
A-----------------------3-----------3-0--------------------------------
E----------------------------------------------------------------------

Empty prayer, empty mouths, combien reaction
Empty prayer, empty mouths, talk about the passion
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world

Then the first verse goes (repeat twice):
E-0-0-0-0-0-0--0-0-0-0-0-0---3-3-3-2-0-0-0-0---------------------------
B-2-2-0-2-2-0--2-2-0-2-2-0---0-0-0-0-0-0-3-3---------------------------
G-2-2-2-2-2-2--2-2-2-2-2-2---0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0---------------------------
D-2-2-2-2-2-2--2-2-2-2-2-2---2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2---------------------------
A-0-0-0-0-0-0--0-0-0-0-0-0---2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2---------------------------
E----------------------------0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0---------------------------
This is like A, Asus, and a variation on E-minor

The 2nd and 3rd verses start with the main riff, but instead of
going right to the A, Asus, etc. it first goes through these licks:
E-------0-------------0-------------0-------------0-0-0----------------
B-----3---3---3-----3---3---3-----3---3---3-----3---3-3----------------
G---2-------------0-------------2-------------0-----0-0----------------
D-3---------3---2---------2---3---------3---2-------2-2----------------
A----------------------------------------------------------------------
E----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before the 2nd verse goes to the 3rd (and the 3rd to the fade out),
a riff is played with the regular D chord (right after Em stuff):
E-2-2-3-5--2-2-3-5--3-3-3-2-2-2-2-2-------2-0--------------------------
B-3-3-3-3--3-3-3-3--3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-----3------------------------------
G-2-2-2-2--2-2-2-2--2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-0-2--------------------------------
D-0-0-0-0--0-0-0-0--0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0------------------------------------
A----------------------------------------------------------------------
E----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fourth verse begins the same way as the other three and fades out
repeating the A / Em stuff.

Talk about the passion
Talk about the passion

Empty prayer, empty mouths, combien reaction
Empty prayer, empty mouths, talk about the passion
Combien, combien, combien de temps?

Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Combien, combien, combien de temps?

Talk about the passion
Talk about the passion
(repeat)

Lyrics:

Scratch the scandals in the twilight
Trying to shock but instead
Idle hands all orient to her
Pass a magic pillow under head
It's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight

They scratch the scandals in the twilight
She was laughing like a Horae
Put that knee in dour landslide
Take this step to dash a roving eye
It's so much more attractive inside the moral kiosk
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight

(repeat first verse)




   PERFECT CIRCLE


{its helpful to play the piano notes by streching your pinky
 along the high E-string on the D and G chords}

F  F/G        D        F   F/G    G
   Put your hair back, we get to leave
 F  F/G        D             G
    Eleven gallows on your sleeve
 F   F/G       D     F F/G     G
    Shallow figure, winner's pain
 F   F/G     D      F          G      F   Dm7
    Eleven shadows way out of place
  C            F              C           Dm
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
  C            F              C           Dm
 Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
  C            F              C           F
  Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room

{same as before}
Pull your dress on and stay real close
Who might leave you where I left off?
A perfect circle of acquaintances and friends
Drink another, coin a phrase
Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room
Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room
Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room

Try to win and suit your needs
Speak out sometimes but try to win
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room

   SITTING STILL


{note: In this song and many other REM songs, there is an A9 chord.
 This chord can be interchanged with Asus2.  Here is my favorite A9
 position:

  (E) -0-    its just like playing an A chord using a 5th fret
  (B) -0-    barre E chord.  If you move it to the seventh fret,
  (G) -6-    it becomes a B11.  On the 8th fret, its a Cmaj7. On
  (D) -7-    the 10th, its a D9add6.  On the 3rd fret, its a very
  (A) -7-    pretty G6 chord.  On the second, its a neat sounding F#
  (E) -5-    sort-of chord. On the first fret, Its a Mexican sounding
             F chord.}


A  BaddE/F# is an easy chord.  It looks like this.  Don't play the A-string.
Obviously, you pick this chord -don't strum, It'll sound shitty.

BaddE/F#           BaddE (normal)
(E) -0-             -0-
(B) -0-             -0-           To switch between these chords, move
(G) -2-             -2-           only ONE finger.
(D) -4-             -4-
(A) -x-             -2-
(E) -2-             -x-


{intro:  A9  G#m F#m /   A9 G#m B /  }

 E                       BaddE/F#    BaddE
This name I got we all agreed
 E                       BaddE/F#    BaddE
See could stop stop it will rid
 E                       BaddE/F#    BaddE
We could bind it in the cist
 E                       BaddE/F#    BaddE
We could gather, throw a fit

 B                            A
Up to buy, Katie buys a kitchen-size, but not me in
 B                            A
Setting trap for love, making a waste of time, sitting still

{same as before}
I'm the sign and you can read.
I'm the sign and you're not deaf.
We could bind it in the cist.
We could gather, throw a fit.

Up to buy, Katie buys a kitchen-size, but not me in
Setting trap for love, making a waste of time, sitting still
I can hear you.  I can hear you.  I can hear you.

This name I got we all agree
See could stop stop it will rid
We could bind it in the cist
We could gather, throw a fit.

Up to buy, Katie buys a kitchen-size, but not me in
Setting trap for love, making a waste of time, sitting still

{same as intro}
I can hear you.  I can hear you.  I can hear you.

You can gather when I talk, talk until you're blue
You could get away from me.  Get away from me.

Up to buy, Katie buys a kitchen-size, but not me
Setting trap for love, making a waste of time, sitting still
I can hear you.  I can hear you.  I can hear you.
I can hear you.  I can hear you.  I can hear you.
Can you hear me?

Lyrics:

Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reenforced.
Now what does that mean?
Is there a just contradiction?
Nothing much.
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord, hesitate.

Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
all nine yards down her back

Give me a couple,
Don't give me a couple of pointers,
Turn to lies and conversation fear

Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
all nine yards down her back

Give me a couple,
Don't give me a couple of pointers,
Turn to lies and conversation fear

What is my mind?
What is my mind?

Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reenforced.
Now what does that mean?
Is there a just contradiction?
Nothing much.
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, oh come on, hesitate, hesitate.

Got to punch
Right on target
Twisting tongues
Gotta stripe down his back
all nine yards down her back

Give me a couple,
Don't give me a couple of pointers,
Turn to lies and conversation fear

Conversation fear. Conversation fear. Conversation fear.



   SHAKING THROUGH


{intro:}
(E) ---5---3---2---0---
(B) ---7---5---3---2---
(G) ---7---5---2---0---
(D) --steady 1/8 notes all the way

{once again, there's a melody line played on the E string with
 the chords, it just alternates between D Dsus2 and Dsus4;
 with the Bm chord, its easier to play a "cheater" chord (no barre)
 then pick out the notes. Or I guess you could play straight chords if
 you're a weenie}

D                Bm               D                   Bm
Could it be that one small voice doesn't count in the world?
Em                   A    Em              A
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way

Could this by three be turned?  Honor marches on.
Em                   A    Em              A
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way

D A     G   (A)  D   A  G   D A     G   (A)  D   A   G
Shaking through, opportune. Shaking through, opportune.

Are we grown way too far?
Taking after rain
Em                   A    Em              A
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way
D A     G   (A)  D   A  G   D A     G   (A)  D   A   G
Shaking through, opportune. Shaking through, opportune.

Em     A         Em     A
In my life

Is that a steal?
Children of today on parade,
Em                   A    Em              A
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way
D A     G   (A)  D   A  G   D A     G   (A)  D   A   G
Shaking through, opportune. Shaking through, opportune.
D A     G   (A)  D   A  G   D A     G   (A)  D   A   G
Shaking through, opportune. Shaking through, opportune.


{At the end, the chorus gets played a key up for a while, so it's
 E     B    A ....    then end on a big 'ol B}



   WE WALK


{intro:  F  Fmaj7  Dm  Dm     F Fmaj7 Dm Dm}

{On the C to Am stuff, It sounds good to walk the bass note of the C
 chord down to a B before playing Am}

 C             Am             C                Am       C    Am  C    Am

Take oasis, Marat's bathing

We walk through the world we walk
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing

Take oasis, Marat's bathing
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Into the hall




   WEST OF THE FIELDS


[Chords by: Trygve Sandven Haaland (db39@oliven.bih.no)]

Em               D              F   G    F              G
Long gone, intuition to assume are gone when we try.
Em                      D               F        G              F       G
Dream of  a living  jungle in my way back home when we die.

Em
West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields.
Em   G     Em   G     Em   G     Em   G     Em
Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. West of the fields.

Dreams of Elysian, to assume are gone when we try
Tell now what is dreaming
When we try to listen with your eyes oversimplify

Em  F               Dm     G C Dm   F                   G
The animals, how strange.       Try, try to stick it in.
Em  F               Dm     G C Dm   F                   G
The animals, how strange.       Try, try to stick it in.

Dreams of Elysian, to assume are gone when we try
Tell now what is dreaming when we try.
Listen through your eyes when we die.

West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields. West of the fields.
Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. Long gone. West of the fields.

Anytime something screeches across the room, and latches onto
someone's neck, and the guy screams, and tries to get it off,
I have to laugh, because what *is* that thing?
