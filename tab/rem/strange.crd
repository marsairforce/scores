  G                                C
 There's something strange going on tonight

  G                                  C
 There's something going on that's not quite right

  G                                          C
 Michael's nervous and the lights are bright

  G                                     C
 There's something going on that's not quite right

 

  E                               Esus4
 There's something going on that wasn't here before

  E              Esus4
 Keep your eyes glued to the floor

  E                                Esus4
 There's something strange going on tonight

  E                                Esus4
 There's something going on that's not quite right

 
 There's something going on that wasn't here before
 Keep your eyes glued to the floor
 No one's going to say goodnight
 There's something going on that's not quite right
