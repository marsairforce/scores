The lick is:
G----------------4-0-0- (I'm not sure about the last bit, but it's about 
D-------------5-5-4-2-0 right)
A-------2-0-3----------
E-0-0-3----------------

Em           Am        G        D
The walls we build up, stone by stone
Hills divided one by one
And the train conductor says "take a break, driver 8
Driver 8, take a break, we've been on this shift too long"

        C                            D
And the train conductor says, take a break, driver 8
       C         D             Em*
Driver 8, take a break, we can reach our destination

Saw a treehouse on the outskirts of a farm
Power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged
Bells are ringing through the town again
Children look up all they hear is sky blue bells ringing

And the train conductor says...

Am                     C
A way to seal away the heat
  G                     D
A way to put myself to sleep
  Am                   C
A way to seal away the heat
  G                    D
A way to put myself my children to sleep

(intro lick)

Pilots did this song on a train like that one
Sis selling faith on the hotel crusade
Locomotive 8, southern crescent hear the bells
This field of wheat is looking thin

And the train conductor says...


*On the Em, there's a lick involving an E-F#-G-F# run in the bass. I just play
this under an Em chord(ie, E minor, Eminor/F#, Em/G, Em/F#)
