   YOU ARE THE EVERYTHING


{intro   Am}

G                                  D
Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing
                          G
I'm very scared for this world
                    D
I'm very scared for me
                   G
Eviscerate your memory
         G
Here's a scene
       D
You're in the back seat laying down
    G
The windows wrap around you
    D
The sound of the travel and the engine
C               G                  C
All you hear is time stand still in travel
                          G
You feel such peace and absolue
                           C
The stillness still that doesn't end
                   G
But slowly drifts into sleep
      D
The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen
     D
And they're there for you
     D                            G
For you alone you are the everything

     G                 D
I think about this world a lot and I cry
      G                         D
And I've seen the films and the eyes
                  G
But I'm in this kitchen
          D
Everything is beautiful
          G
And she is so beautiful
                 D
She is so young and old
                  C
I look at her and I see the beauty
     G
Of the light of music
      C                       G
The voice is talking somewhere in the house
                 C
Late spring and you're drifting off to sleep
         D
With your teeth in your mouth
D
You are here with me
D
You are here with me
D                     Am
You have been here and you are everything

{intro:  E   A   B}

  E           A                B
Stand in the place where you live
 A    A/G# E
Now face North
 E            A
Think about direction
         F#        B  A    E
Wonder why you haven't before
      E            A               B
Now stand in the place where you were
 A  A/G#  E
Now face West
 E                 A
Think about the place where you live
 F#              B  A   E
Wonder why you haven't before

 E             A       C#       C    B
If you are confused check with the sun
 E        A         G        A B
Carry a compass to help you along
      E         A       C#    C   B
Your feet are going to be on the ground
      E         A       G     G A B
Your head is there to move you around

Your feet are going to be on the ground
Your head is there to move you around
If wishes were trees the trees would be falling
Listen to reason
The reason is calling

   WORLD LEADER PRETEND


 {between the Em and Bm chords play this ----
  (D) -0-2-4-2-0-                  }

{intro  Em   Bm   Em   Bm  Em   Bm    G     A }

  D            G    C                 D
 I sit at my table and wage war on myself
  D   G               C                  D
 It seems like it's all...it's all for nothing
  D           G         C
 I know the barricades, and
               D             D
 I know the mortar in the wall breaks
      G                  C                 D
 I recognize the weapons, I used them well

  Em  Bm
  Em                  Bm
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good
  Em                     Bm                            G    A
 I raised the wall, and I will be the one to knock it down

 I've a rich understanding of my finest defenses
 I proclaim that claims are left unstated,
 I demand a rematch
 I decree a stalemate
 I divine my deeper motives
 I recognize the weapons
 I've practiced them well. I fitted them myself

 It's amazing what devices you can sympathize...empathize
 This is my mistake.  Let me make it good
 I raised the walls, and I will be the one to knock it down

{I lose track of where the chords occur over the words. They just
 switch between Am and C  until the last part of this section...}

  Am            C          Am                     C
 Reach out for me and hold me tight.  Hold that memory
     Am           C           Am             A           G
 Let my machine talk to me.  Let my machine talk to me

 This is my world
 And I am the world leader pretend
 This is my life
 And this is my time
 I have been given the freedom
 To do as I see fit
 It's high time I've razed the walls
 That I've constructed

 It's amazing what devices you can sympathize...emapathize
 This is my mistake. Let me make it good
 I raised the walls, and I will be the one to knock it down

 You fill in the mortar. You fill in the harmony
 You fill in the mortar. I raised the walls
 And I'm the only one
 I will be the one to knock it down

{end on Em}

Lyrics:

I've watched the children come and go
A late long march into spring
I sit and watch those children
Jump in the tall grass
Leap the sprinkler
Walk in the ground
Bicycle clothespin spokes
The sound the smell of swingset hands

I will try to sing a happy song
I'll try and make a happy game to play

Come play with me I whispered to my new found friend
Tell me what it's like to go outside
I've never been
Tell me what it's like to just go outside
I've never been
And I never will

I'm not supposed to be like this
I'm not supposed to be like this
But it's okay

Hey those kids are looking at me
I told my friend myself
Those kids are looking at me
They're laughing and they're running over here
They're laughing and they're running over here
What do I do?
What can I do?
What should I do?
What do I say?
What can I say?

I said I'm no supposed to be like this
Let's try to find a happy game to play
Let's try to find a happy game to play
I'm not supposed to be like this
But it's okay...okay

  Em
 Follow me don't follow me

 I've got my spine I've got my orange crush
  Em
 Collar me don't collar me

 I've got my spine I've got my orange crush

 I've had my fun and now its time to
  Em
 Spread your conscience overseas
  G              D
 Coming in fast over me

{the break is:   Emajor     B        F#     B   as many times as necessary}

We'd circle and we'd circle and we'd circle to stop and consider and
sitting there on the pavement stacked up all the trucks jacked up and
our wheels in slush and orange crush in pocket and all this here county
hell any county it's just like heaven here and i was remembering and i
was just in a differnet county and all then this whirlybird that i
headed for i had my goggles pulled off i knew it all i knew every back

Lyrics:
Divide your cultured pearls in haste
I'm looking for to lay to waste
Of all the things I cannot taste
This is not the wasted race
They spoke loud

I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you
It's what you do

I could turn you inside-out
But I choose not to do

Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheers




   HAIRSHIRT


{This song repeats these 8 measures throughout the verses:

G / / / G / / / A7 / / / A7 / / / C / / / C / / / G / / / G / / /}

I am not the type of dog
That could keep you waiting
For no good reason
Run a carbon-black test on my jaw
And you will find it's all been said before

 G    A7             C                      Am
I can swing my megaphone and long arm the rest
       Am
It's easier and better
                            C      C
To just beat it from the chest
Of desire       G

{verse}
I could walk into this room
And the waves of conversation are enough
To knock you down in the undertow
So alone so alone in my life
Feed me banks of light
And hang your hairshirt on the lowest rung
It's a beautiful life
And I can hang my hairshirt
Away up high in the attic of the wrong dog's life chest
Or bury it at sea
All my life I've searched for this

Here I am here I am in your life
It's a beautiful life
My life
It's a beautiful life
Your life

Lyrics:

I remember redwood trees, bumper cars and wolverines
The ocean's Trident submarines
Lemons, limes and tangerines
I remember this
I remember traffic jams
Motor boys and girls with tans
Nearly was and almost rans
I remember this

History is made
History is made to seem unfair
I recall that you were there
Golden smile and shining hair
I recall it wasn't fair
Recollect it wasn't fair
Remembering it wasn't fair outside

The willow at high tide
The lowest ebb and highest tide
The simple wave I must confide
I guess we took a slow ride
I guess it's just a gesture

I remember this defense
Progress fails pacific sense
All those sweet conspiracies
I remember all these things
I remember traffic jams
Motor boys and girls with tans
Nearly was and almost rans
I remember this
This

At the end of the continent
At the edge of the continent




   (UNTITLED)


C
This world is big and so-awake
G                   C
I stayed up late to hear your voice
C
This light is here to keep you warm
                               G
This song is here to keep you strong

I made a list of things to say
But all I really want to say
All I really want to say is
Hold her and keep him strong
While I'm away from here
Hold her and keep her strong
While I'm away from here


   {break:    F7   C   F7   G}

I've seen the world and so-awake
And stay up late to hear me sing
Just hold her
I've seen the world and so-awake
And stay up late to hear me sing
Just hold him
Hold her and keep her strong
While I'm away from here
Hold him and keep him strong
While I'm away from here
