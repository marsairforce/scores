Well, I tried this once, but failed.  Oops. :-)

Find the River
---------------

Intro: D (arpeggiate) D add C (arpeggiate)

Riff: 
E---3---2---0---2----------5---3---1---3
B------------------3--------------------
G----------------------2----------------
D---------------------------------------
A---------------------------------------
E---------------------------------------

Chords:
D                  F              A5 
Hey now, little sleepy head the (mumble mumble mumble mumble)
    D              F          A5
We have to go to task in the city
        D                F           A5                G
Where people drown and people surf, don't be shy you just deserve
      D          F            A5
It's only just light-years to go.

G                     D                  A              G
Me, my thoughts are flower strewn and (mumble mumble mumble mumble)
G              D                A
I have got to leave to find my way 
etc.

At least, that's what I _think_ I hear.  The A5 is a bit problematic,
but the only notes that seemed to fit when I played along were A and E...

Naturally, any corrections are welcome :-)

	I found that the intro is actually an arpeggiated D then an arpeggiated
modified E7... It looks like this... (bear with me this is my first time...)

e ----------3----------------3-------------------
B -----3----2-----------3----3--------------------
G ---2------3---------0------0--------------------  
D -0--------0-------2--------2-------------------
A -----------------------------------------------         
E -----------------------------------------------

Other than that, the rest sounds right... Any other suggestions and corrections

to mine are welcome, too :-)

     Here is the (hopefully) long awaited posting of the improved
and complete R.E.M. song "Find the River."  I had some help with
the lyrics (kind of complicated don't you think) from Leon Shugrue
who looked them up at an FTP site.  Anyway, I hope everyone likes
this post.  More R.E.M. is coming soon... 

P.S.- Could somebody please re-post the Spin-Doc's songs???

                         Find the River

Intro (TAB)
          {strum D once)      {strum D except finger 2nd fret on D

Intro:  D      Dm     A7sus4   Dsus 
        D      Dm     A7sus4
------------------------------------
 D                Dm           A7sus4              Dsus
Hey now little speedy head the read on the speedometer says
    D             Dm          A7sus4
you have to go the task in the city
    D                 Dm
Where people drown and people serve
A7sus4               Dsus           D        Dm          A7sus4
Don't be shy, your just deserve is only just light years to go

(Chorus:)
  G                     A              D                   Em
Me my thoughts are flowers strewn, an ocean storm may bury them
  G             A              D    (Dsus)
I have got to leave to find my way
  G                   A            D                   Em
Watch the road and memorize this life that passed before my eyes
    G          A         D
and nothing is going my way

     D              Dm            A7sus4               Dsus     
The ocean is the river's goal, the need to leave the water knows
     D              Dm            A7sus4
We're closer now, but light years to go

   G           A                D            Em  
I have got to find the river, bergamot and bed of rose
  G            A            D
Run through my head and far away
  G               A              D               Em
Leave the road and memorize this life that passed before my eyes
  G            A        D
and nothing is going my way


There's no one left to take the lead
But I'll tell you and you can see
We're closer now and light years to go

    (repeat chorus chords for these last 4 verses)

Pick up here and chase the ride
River empties to the tide, fall into the ocean
River to the ocean goes a fortune for the undertow
None of this is going my way

There is nothing left to grow
but Ginger, mint and indigo
Coriander stem and rows of hay

Strength and courage overrides
The privileged and weary eyes
River poets search naivete

Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
All of this is coming your way
