                    A
We passed upon the stairs,
                  D
Spoken walls and wells,
                  A
Although I was a friend
                F
Sat on walls astrand,
                    C
Which came as so surprised,
                 A                           D
I spoke into his eyes -- I thought you died alone
                    C
A long long time ago

(First chorus)

Oh no, not me,
   C#                C
We never lost control,

The face, to face,
         C#
With the man who sold the world.

{ Play intro 6x }

                        A
I laughed and shook his hand,
                  D
Made my way back home,
                         A
I searched from farther land,
                      F
Years and years I roamed,
                      C
I gazed all gazers there,
                     A                         D
We walked a million hills -- I must have died alone,
                    C
A long long time ago.

(Second chorus)

Who knows, not me,
  C#                C
I never lost control,

Your face, to face,
         C#
With the man who sold the world.

{ Play intro 6x }

Repeat second chorus.

Enjoy people!

I should have the unplugged version of "On A Plain" ready by
tomorrow.  And judging from the response I got to post this,
I'll just post it immediately without asking. ;-)

Here are some revisions to the lyrics of The Man Who Sold the World, as I
