Organization: California State University Sacramento


Title:     Even In His Youth
Artist:    Nirvana;  lyrics and music by Kurt Cobain. 
Recording: 2nd track on the "Smells Like Teen Spirit" CD single.  Also known 
              as "Smells Like a Teenage Single".  Previously unreleased. 
Tab:       1.0   by Peter Jay Salzman   psalzman@stars.sfsu.edu 
Beat:      Allegro, about 144 bpm. 
Sound:     Not Cobain's standard sound, which is why this tune is interesting.
              Very distorted with the mids turned up super duper (ie 10) and 
              lows turned up also.  A very muddy distortion with lots of 
              harmonics giving it an almost pipe organ sound. A very Marshall 
              sound, but in the OPPOSITE sense of Hendrix who had the treble
              turned high.


       
Intro: Feedback on 12 fret, 1st string (high E). 

The following riff is the vamp and verse.  For those who want to do it
just like the recording, vamp the 2 measures 2 times, then drums enter
on the third time.  Vocals enter on the fifth repeat.



    C           G       G#      G       C           G       G#      G

chorus (1st time around):                  chorus (2nd time around): 
  1st line is truly incomprehensible.        1st line incomprehensible 
  I've got nothing left to prove             I've got nothing left to prove
  If I die far away                          If I die far away 
  Hope I don't come back again.              Hope I don't come back the same. 



After the chorus is done the 2nd time, go back and play the verse part.
The song fades from here while Kurt just sang "even his youth   even in
his youth   even in his youth  even in his youth".   If you can't fade
gracefully (I'm not good at it myself), chop it off at the C.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my 1st tab. I'm just trying to put back into the net a little bit of 
what I take. I have 4 urgent requests from everyone: 1) If there are any 
corrections in the song or lyrics PLEASE write to me and I'll correct it and 
rerelease the tab. 2) If anyone can even guess at the 1st line in the chorus, 
please let me know. 3) I'm not objective enough to know if I did a good job. 
If there's anything I can do to make this more usable, let me know. (ie should
I just write out the verse instead of partitioning by chord? Should I write 
out the whole tab instead of taking short cuts like "repeat 4 times").  No 
suggestion is too trivial to be seriously considered. 4) What Kurt did was 
fucked and he's a fucker for doing it, but he brought a lot of good music in 
the world and deserves to be loved for it. I can be reached at:
