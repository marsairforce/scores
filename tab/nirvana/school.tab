I thought I would post a little Nirvana tab for those beginners who want
to rock.  Here's what I figured out from _Bleach_:

School
======
by Nirvana


Main line:                            bend
                                       1/2
e[--------------------------------------^-]
B[--------------------------------------|-]
G[--------------------------------------|-]
D[--------------------------------------|-]
A[-------------------------------------/--]
E[-0---0--0-\7--0--0-\7--0---0-0-0-0--6---]

The main line repeats throughout all the verses

Verse:
Won't you believe it. It's just my luck
Won't you believe it. It's just my luck
Won't you believe it. It's just my luck

Chorus:  

D5       C5      E5       C5
/  ///   / / /   /  ///   / / /
         NO RECESS        NO RECESS


Then there's the solo which I'll tab out if anyone really wants it.

Interlude: (Only the bass plays here)
You're on school again
You're on school again
You're on school again
YOU'RE ON SCHOOL AGAIN!

Back to chorus. End.

1st verse:
(w/Riff)
Won't you believe it it's just my luck (4x)

Chorus:
C A    E     D     C     A        (riff)
  No recess  No recess   No recess

2nd verse: (same as 1st)

Chorus

Solo

3rd verse:
(w/riff)
You're on acid again. (4x)

Chorus

I figured it was probably time I posted something, and this was the
easiest thing to post I could think of.
