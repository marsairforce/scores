Just follow the chords below, and you should
pretty much have the song:



 A#5         B   C#5       F#5
Congradulations, you have won

 A#5             B        C#5    F#5
It's a useless discretion of that kind

A#5                 B    C#5      F#5
If it makes your story, I'm concerned

A#5        B       C#5      F#5
You set it up, your glory burns



   A#5    B    C#5 F#5    A#5    B   C#5 F#5
My opinions... hmmmm... My opinion... mhmmm

   A#5    B   C#5  F#5     A#5   B   C#5 F#5
My opinions... hmmmm... My opinion... mhmmm



    A#5        B     C#5     F#5
There seems to be a problem here

     A#5                  B         C#5        F#5
When you scared them all off, it seemed real clear

 A#5           B        C#5    F#5
Now the risen follower watches tough

    A#5          B           C#5     F#5
And they haven't plauged the hope he saw



      A#5     B  C#5 F#5      A#5     B  C#5  F#5
I got opinions... hmmmm... My opinions... mhmmm

    A#5    B  C#5  F#5     A#5    B   C#5  F#5

Congradulations, you have won

 A#5             B        C#5    F#5
It's a useless discretion of that kind

A#5                 B    C#5      F#5
If it makes your story, I'm concerned

A#5        B       C#5      F#5
You set it up, your glory burns




     A#5    B   C#5  F#5       A#5   B   C#5 F#5 
Your opinions... hmmmm... Your opinion... hmmmm

     A#5    B   C#5  F#5       A#5   B   C#5 F#5
Your opinions... hmmmm... Your opinion... mhmmm
              
                    A#5

Well, I've never heard the song so I can't say whether or not
your tab is wrong, but a few of your chord names are wrong. The
F#5 is actually just an F5.  The B is not a B. B would look
like this:
E------
B------
G--4---
D--4--- 
A--2---
E------

What you might mean is an F#5, which would be:
E-------         E------
B-------         B------
G-------  or     G--3---
D--4----         D--4---
A--4----         A--4---
E--2----         E--2---

Just my 2 cents...I hope I made sense, for once. :)
