Load up on guns, bring your friends      
It's fun to lose, and to pretend          
She's over bored, and self assured
I know I know, A dirty word

	hello, hello, hello, hello. . .hello, hello, hello, hello,
	hello, hello, hello, hello. . .hello, hello, hello, hello

	With the lights out it's less dangerous
	Here we are now, entertain us
	I feel stupid and contagious
	Here we are now, entertain us.
	A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido, Yea!

I'm worse at what I do best,        
and for this gift I feel blessed.   
I met a group that's always been    
And always will until the end.      

And I forget, just why i taste    
Oh yes I guess it makes me smile    
I found it hard. . .Its hard to find 
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

Care if I'm old

I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
If I don't have a mind

Even if you have
Even if you need
I don't mean to stare
We don't have to breed
We could plant a house
We could build a tree
I don't even care
We could have all three

  they're  in   my  head. . . 

I'm so ugly but that's ok, 'cause so are you, we've broke our mirrors
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found god

I'm so lonely and that's ok, I shaved my head, and I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard, and I'm not sure
I'm so excited I can't wait to meet you there, and I dont' care
I'm so horny but that's ok, my will is good

It isn't me
We have some seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To please myself
I've got some rope
You have been told
I promise you
I've been true
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To please myself


Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like more food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

A5     F5     D5     A5       F5      D5
When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions.


A5                   F5              D5
Gotta find a way, to find a way, I'd better wait.

Chew your meat for you
pass it   back and forth
In a      passionate kiss,
>from my   mouth to yours

        A5 G5   F#5
because I  like you.

With eyes so dialted I've become your pupil
You've taught me everything with a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful.  Vacuum out the fluids.

                       Lounge Act

Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it wouldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you

Don't, tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowning fear
Experience anything yoy need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you

Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it wouldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To make you a deal
We've make a pact
To learn from who
Ever we want
Without new rules
We'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way
To prove they still
Smell her on you
They still, smell her on you
Smell her on you

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Stay Away


Monkey See, monkey do
I'd rather be deal than cool
Every line ends in rhyme
Less is more, love is blind

Stay, stay away

Give an inch, take a smile
Fashion shits, fashion stile
Throw it out and keep it in
Have to have poison skin

I don't know why
I don't know why

                       On A Plain


I'll start this off
Without any words
I got so high that
I scratched 'til I bled

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

The finest day
That I ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

My mother died
Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that

The black sheep got
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense

One more special
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home

Underneath the bridge
The tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
But it's ok to eat fish
Cause they haven't any feelings
