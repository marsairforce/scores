Summary: I'm very ape and very nice....
Keywords: My fave on the album..





	**** Very Ape **** from `In Utero` side2,track1-by Nirvana

	This is one of my favorites on the album.Needless to say it's the
one I am probably most wrong on. So FWIW here goes...

	Cool biting,overdriven,make-you-break-out-in-a-cold-sweat guitar.

Verse:   If you ever need anything please dont...,
      **
E|----------------------------------------|-
B|----2-2-----3-3---------2-2--------3-3--|-
G|-0--2-2--0--3-3----0----2-2----0---3-3--|-
D|-0--2-2--0--3-3----0----2-2----0---3-3--|-
A|-0-------0---------0-----------0--------|-
E|----------------------------------------|-

		Repeat during Verse.Every other time playing 1st A chords
		( the ones marked `*` ) like this:  0
						    2
						    2
					            2
                                      		    X 
						    X
I use X to indicate the string not being played at all (not meaning dampened)

At the part " I'm very ape and very nice " the guitar is:

                	G            F
                 	3            1
                        3            1
                        4            2
                        5            3
                        5            3
                        3            1
Chorus

      Out of the Ground, Into the sky  , Out of the sky, into the dirt. 
A C E            A  C E           A C E             A C E         A C E

0 X 7   
X X X
		Slide the barre up to the chords.
The lead guitar over this is as such:
