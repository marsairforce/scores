For all you beginners out there (and this includes me) Here is most of
the tab to Nirvana's "Smells like Teen Spirit."  As taught to me by
the lead guitarist of THE RETARDZ, Dan Rosini.  Hey, if *I* can play it,
anybody can play it. . .


Key:
     p - pull off from previous note
     / - slide to 
     b - bend note
     x - mute strings w/palm 


Main line:                              Riff:         Wait for obnoxious
2x w/o distortion.                                      vocals to end. . .

Seeing as lotsa people have been arguing about the intro to SMELLS LIKE
TEEN SPIRIT, I thought I'd fan the flames and throw in my version.

Some guy said he reckons he hears a G, and indeed he's right.  He also
raised doubt as to whether all the chords are plain root-fifth-root,
and again he's right because there are some suspended fourth chords.
You have to be REALLY quick to catch 'em, but they're there.

Have any guitar mags tabbed this ?  What did they say ?

Here you go.  This is updated from (ie better than) the file I
originally posted to Nevada.  It isn't necessarily how Cobain plays it,
but it sounds pretty accurate.


Smells Like Teen Spirit,    by Nirvana

For those interested, a good way to get the Nirvana "Grunge" sound is
just to use very heavy metal distortion plus very thick chorus.

Key:
     p - pull off from previous note
     s - slide to
     b - bend (or unbend) note until it sounds like the next one
     x - strike strings muted lightly w/left hand

Main line:                                         Riff:
 2x w/o distortion.                                repeat as
 4x with distortion + chorus                       desired. . .

Lyrics:
-------
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose, and to pretend
She's overboard, myself assured
I know I know, A dirty word

        *chorus*

        hello, hello, hello, hello. . .hello, hello, hello, how low. . .
        hello, hello, hello, hello. . .hello, hello, hello, how low. . .

        With the lights out it's less dangerous
        Here we are now, entertain us
        I feel stupid and contagious
        Here we are now, entertain us.
        A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido, Yea!

	*bridge*

I'm worse at what I do best,
and for this gift I feel blessed.
I met a group that's always been
And always will until the end.

        *chorus, bridge, solo*

And I forget, just what the taste
And yes I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard. . .Its hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

        chorus.
