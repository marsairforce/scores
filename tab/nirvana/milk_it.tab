Here's my attempt to transcribe "Milk It " from In Utero 
( It's probably wrong , but It's hard to remember the exact tab
without the help of my guitar )


this song could be played using Dropped D tuning (low to high :DADGBE)
But I'll tab it the ordinary way (EBGDAE) 
NOTE: It sounds much heavier using the Dropped D tuning .
