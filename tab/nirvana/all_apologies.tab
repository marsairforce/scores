  Hmm... Well, I've been playing it a bit differently. The way I play it
seems to fit perfectly with the version on the album, but I think the
unplugged version is a bit different... 

Here's mine:

1/2 step down, dropped D tuning

Eb|----------------------------------------------------------
Bb|----------------------------------------------------------
Gb|----------------------------------------------------------
Db|-------------------------------------------12--12--10--9--
Ab|-----9--10--9--12--12--10--9-----9--10--9-----------------
Db|--0---------------------------0---------------------------


Eb|----------------------------------------------------------
Bb|----------------------------------------------------------
Gb|-------------------------------------------11--11--9------
Db|------------------------------------------------------12--
Ab|-----9--10--9--12--12--10--9-----9--10--9-----------------
Db|--0---------------------------0---------------------------  

 Repeated twice before the singing begins, and only the first part
being repeated during each of the verses. 
(Uhhh.. does that make sense?... Well, listen to the song, 
you'll get it :)

And I'm pretty sure the chorus chords are something like:

  |-----                   |-----
  |--0--                   |-----
  |--4--  Strummed, then   |--6--  For the 'married, burried' 
  |--5--                   |--7--   part.
  |--5--                   |--7--
  |--0--                   |--7--
     ^  
     Could be 5, I can't realy hear a difference.

 That looks about right... 

  I know pretty much all of the songs on In Utero and Nevermind, and
most of the songs on Bleach and Incesticide. I might put some more of 'em
up...

Pretty easy, but I'm finding it hard to sing along. Here it is, but first, you have to tune your low E string down to D.

All notes are eighths, except for the open Ds, which provides the cool droning:

E|------------------------------|------------------------------|
B|------------------------------|------------------------------|
G|------------------------------|------------------------------|
D|------------------------------|--------------12--12--10--10--|
A|----9--10--9--12--12--10--10--|----9--10--9------------------|
D|-0---------0--(0)-------------|-0---------0--(0)-------------|
                s                              s

E|------------------------------|------------------------------|            
B|------------------------------|------------------------------|             
G|------------------------------|--------------11--11--9---7---|             
D|------------------------------|----------------------0-------|               
A|----9--10--9--12--12--10--10--|----9--10--9------------------|
D|-0---------0--(0)-------------|-0---------0------------------|               
                s                          

Other notes: The open D notes in parentheses is what he plays in the intro once
the riff gets rolling. This is NOT how the very beginning is. If you can play
and hear the above, you can figure out what's different about the beginning.
Also, I'm not sure he plays these parenthetical open Ds once the main verses 
start.
 
Secondly, an 's' underneath indicates you slide UP to the melody note, but 
pick it BEFORE you slide. Good luck, and let me know if it's wrong or anything.
