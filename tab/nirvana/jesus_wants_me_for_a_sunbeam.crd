The song is properly titled as above and is originally by tehe
Vaselines who , IMHO do a better take on it than Nirvana

The vas version is

D          C         G G/c G
Jesus don't want me for a sunbeam
over and over
D         C
don't expect me to cry
D 

D         C
Don't expect me to lie

The nirvana one
the chords are just  E   D   A  Asus4? A

I am not positive what to call the G/c
It's just a G chord with the first two fingers dropped a string
to the upper part of a C chord

A sus4 is just the pinky slid up to the third fret.


This song is super easy yet super good.
Mike
