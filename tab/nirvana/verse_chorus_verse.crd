Verse Chorus Verse
as recorded by Nirvana
>from the No Alternative benefit album (last track-uncredited)

words and music by the late, great Kurt Cobain
transcribed by Robert Wolsey

Tuning (low to high string):  Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb

Notes:  I think Kurt played this one using flat tuning, since 
it was recorded for In Utero and everything on that CD is 
tuned down a half step.  The chords shown below are the 
chords you're pretending to play; the chords that come out 
are a half step lower because of the tuning.  


D          A#   G        A
And if you save yourself

         A#       F      D
You will make him happy

               A#   G    A
He'll keep you in a jar

           A#           F      D
And you'll think you're happy

               A#        G      A
He'll give you breathing holes

           A#           F      D
And you'll think you're happy

            A#       G     A
He'll cover you with dust

           A#           G     D    A#
And you'll think you're happy now

            G             A#
You're in a laundry room

            G             A#
You're in a laundry room

              G            A#   A
The clue that came to you, oh


And if you guard yourself
You will think you're happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll make him happy
He'll give you breathing holes
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you with dust
Then you'll think you're happy now

You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
The clue that came to you, oh

(guitar solo over verse chords)

You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
The clue that came to you, oh

And if you fool yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breathing holes
Then you will seem happy
You'll wallow in the shit
Then you'll think you're happy now

You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
The clue that came to you, oh
