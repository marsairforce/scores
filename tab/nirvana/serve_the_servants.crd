Serve the Servants
Words and music by Kurt Cobain
>From Nirvana's In Utero (1993)
Transcribed by Robert Wolsey

To play along with the CD (or any boots of the last tour), 
tune down a half step: Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb.

I still don't know the opening chord, but I've pretty  much 
figured out the rest of it, partly by watching the Oakland 
video.  I'm not great at naming chords, so help me out here. 
Here are the fingerings for the chords used:  

       E A D G B E
Bm7    x 2 4 2 x x
Em7?   x x 2 4 3 x *
F#?    2 4 4 3 0 0 * 
E      0 2 2 1 0 0
A      5 7 7 6 5 5
C#     x 4 6 6 6 4
G      3 5 5 4 3 3

* name that chord!


Verse riff:

Bmin7             Emin7
Teenage angst has paid off well

F#                E
Now I'm bored and old

Bmin7          Emin7
Self appointed judges judge

F#                  E
More than they have sold

Bmin7              Emin7
If she floats then she is not

F#                  E
A witch like we had thought

Bmin7             Emin7
A down payment on another

F#             E
One at Salem's lot

A          C#           A
 Serve the servants, oh no

          C#           A
Serve the servants, oh no

          C#           A
Serve the servants, oh no

          C# 
Serve the servants

F#             G                 C#
That legendary divorce is such a bore


As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead I had a Dad

I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before


 Corrections?  I'll take all the blame at wolser@rpi.edu.
