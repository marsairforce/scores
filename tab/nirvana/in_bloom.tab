Well, I have noticed a few mistakes, so here is the corrected verson, 
ready for submission.

Normal Tuning is used, like all the other songs on Nevermind that I know of.
The guitar is quite distorted throughout the song, except where noted.

Intro:
e--------------------------------------------------------------------
b--------------------------------------------------------------------
g--------------------------------------------------------------------
d-8---8--5----5--5---3---3--6----6--6---8---8--5----5--5---3---3--6-x
a-8---8--5----5--5---3---3--6----6--6---8---8--5----5--5---3---3--6-x
E-6---6--3----3--3---1---1--4----4--4---6---6--3----3--3---1---1--4-x
      ^       ^  ^       ^       ^  ^       ^       ^  ^       ^
Strums are in sync with drum beats, and ones marked with ^ are especially 
so, so they are hard to notice.  Listen to the album.

Then do this twice...

e----------------------------------------
b----------------------------------------
g----------------------------------------
d-8---8--xx4---4--xx11/13--13--xx9---7---
a-8---8--xx4---4--xx11/13--13--xx9---7---
E-6---6--xx2---2--xx09/11--11--xx7---5---
      ^       ^           ^^
Bass only for first half of verse, then guitar joins in on second half.
Thanks to Aarom Bernay for comming close to the actual chords here.  Here 
is how I now think it's done

   Spring is here    a-gain

e -1---1-1-xx2---2-2-xx3---3-3----------

g -3---3-3-xx3---3-3-xx3---3-3-xx4---2--

       @	 @	   @
Strums pointed at with @s here are upward strums. ( I think)  This is 
with clean guitar, and what makes me think this may not be it is that it 
is so much tougher than the rest of the song, besides the solo.

He also submitted his version of the chorus.  He was right, and I have 
changed mine to reflect it.
The chorus is pretty well drowned out by the lyrics, but it's like 
this..(back to distortion, of course!)

a-8----8--5----5--5---
d-8----8--5----5--5---
E-5----5--3----3--3---
       ^       ^  ^
four times,

then

a-10----10--13----13--13---
d-10----10--13----13--13---
E-08----08--11----11--11---
        ^         ^   ^
repeated twice.

And, as the chorus is repeated twice, do this again for the second rep.

Now play the same chords played at the beginning of the intro (the four 
in the first few lines of the tab).  However, don't mute the last chord, 
and treat the second half of the line as if it were identical to the 
first half.  Instead of the mute, strum it twice more, then mute right 
when the verse starts.

Verse two is played exactly like verse one.

Then do the chorus routine again, and the intro/chorus chords again just 
like the first time, but go into a weird guitar solo instead of the usual 
verse routine.

For the third chorus, the first rep is the same as always, but for the 
second rep, repeat the "knows not what it means" riff two extra times, 
because "knows not what it means" is repeated two extra times.

Then, as usual after a chorus, do the riffs first seen in the intro, same 
old routine used after the chorus every other time, but add one more e#5 
chord at the end, muted after one second.

That's it.  The solo is beyond my musical skills to figure out now, but 
everything else is here.

Will somebody PLEASE transcribe that dang solo?
