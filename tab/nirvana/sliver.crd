Sliver

C       F        C    A
Mom and Dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed,
"Please don't go"


Chorus:
A              C
Gramma take me home (8x)


I had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff that I
Couldn't chew my meat too good

Chorus

They said if I couldn't stop cryin'
To go outside and rot and die (?)
That's what I did, I kicked the door

Chorus

After dinner I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms

Chorus (20x)
