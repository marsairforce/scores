It seems not too long ago many people were posting their rendition of this
song and such, so I decided to take every version of this song that was
posted and turn it into what I thought was a decent version, based on sound
and ease of play.  

The Beatles

In My Life
----------

Main Riff: E----5-----0-4-
           B--2---2-3-----
           G--2-----------

There are places I'll remember  
          A             F#m

All my life though some have changed
       Bm Dm       A

Some for ever not for better
         A            F#m

Some have gone, and some remain.
          Bm Dm     A

All these places have their moments
          F#m               Bm

With lovers and friends, I still can recall
     G                     A

Some are dead and some are living
         F#m               Bm

In my life, I've loved them all
   D  Dm         A

{Repeat main riff, and continue as verse above}

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compared with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Thought I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I'll love you more
In my life I'll love you more

At the end, there is the first riff above, then a higher Dm (played as a bar
chord at the 5th fret) then the riff below:

                             E7       A
Last Riff: E----5-----0-4----4--2--4--5
           B--2---2-3--------3--------5
           G--2--------------4--------6
           D--------------------------7

CHORD FORMATIONS:
A   x 0 2 2 2 0
F#m 2 4 4 2 2 2  (Bar across 2nd fret)
Bm  x x 4 4 3 2
Dm  x x 0 2 3 1
G   3 2 0 0 3 3

The posting is more or less correct, but missing a few chords in a place or two. 
Also, most of the chords called out as Bm are actually D chords (which are closely related, of course).  See if this sounds more authentic to your ears.

	Anyone who plays a lot of Beatles probably knows that about the time of
HELP/RUBBER SOUL/REVOLVER the Beatles were using a capo on the second fret a
lot to change songs with a D chord to the key of E.  RUBBER SOUL has so many
examples (Nowhere Man, Norwegian Wood, I'm Looking Through You) and with capos
on other frets (Girl, If I Needed Someone) so I tried "In My Life" with a capo
on the second fret and it became MUCH easier.
	
	I can't say for certain if it's right. But if you play it like that, it
becomes:

	Opening riff (Assuming capo on 2nd fret and reading zeros as open
strings and so on)

   G                   D
I-------3----------I---2-----------I
I---0------0--1--3-I---3-----------I 
I------------------I---2-----------I
I------------------I---0-----------I
I------------------I---------------I
I---3--------------I---------------I

	The best part of playing it this way is you can play the open chords
right along with the riff easily, so with only one guitar it sounds pretty
good. Of course, the G and D chords are actually A and E, but if you don't have
a capo on, then they are G and D.

	These chords are the ones you would play with a capo on the second fret

           G      D      Em    G-7         C-->Cm       G
 There are places I'll remember     In my life  though some have changed.

           G    D       Em  G-7               C--> Cm    G
 Some forever  not for better.      Some have gone and some remain.


BRIDGE

           Em               C
 All these places have their moments 
        F                   G
 With lovers and friends I still can recall.
          Em                 A
 Some are dead and some are living.
        Cm         G
 In my life, I've loved them all.


The final riff of the song goes:

        G               D           D-7           G
I-------3------------I--2------------2--0--2-I----3----------I
I---0-------0--1--3--I--3------------1-------I----0----------I
I--------------------I--2------------2-------I----0----------I
I--------------------I--0------------0-------I----0----------I
I--------------------I-----------------------I----2----------I
I---3----------------I-----------------------I----3----------I

	If you listen to the end of the record, you can hear the open B string
ring out and also the D-7 trill is a breeze to play this way and sounds just
like the record. That's why I think at least one guitar on the record had a
capo on the second fret.

	Other Beatles songs with capos on the 2nd fret (for anyone interested)
include "I've Just Seen A Face", "And Your Bird Can Sing", "Polythene Pam",
"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me And My Monkey", "Julia", "She
Said, She Said", and I'm sure there's more I'm not mentioning.
	If anyone wants the chords for these with a capo on, post a request and
I'll do my best (hey, that rhymes).

						Mike
