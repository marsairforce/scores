{title:Girl}
{subtitle:Lennon/McCartney}

Is there [Am]anybody [E]goin' to listen [C]to my [Am]story
[Dm]all about a [G7]girl who came to [C]stay?  [E]
She's the [Am]kind of girl you [E]want so much it [C]makes you [Am]sorry;
[Dm]still, you don't re[G7]gret a single [C]day.  [E]
Ah, [C]gi---[Am]-----[Dm]-----[G7]rl!      [C]gi---[Am]----[Dm]----[G7]rl!    

When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry;
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her.
After all this time I don't know why.
Ah, girl! Girl!

    She's the kind of girl [Dm]who puts you [A7]down
    when friends are there, you feel a [Dm]fool.
    Dee dee dee [A7]Deedeedeedee deedeedeedee.
    [Dm]When you say she's looking good
    she [A7]acts as if it's unterstood.
    She's [Dm]cool, cool, [F]cool, cool.
    [C]Gi---[Am]-----[Dm]-----[G7]rl!      [C]gi---[Am]----[Dm]----[G7]rl!    

Was she told when she was young that fame would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe when he's dead?
Ah, girl! Girl!
