That Georgia's always on my-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind


Been away so long I hardly knew the place,
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case,
Honey disconnect the phone


Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south,
take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear you balalaikas ringing out,
come and keep your comrade warm

This is how I remember the lick in the refrain:


5---5----------8----8-----------10----10--------------
5-8-7----------8-11-10----------10-13-12--------------
------5h6p5h6----------8h7p8h7-----------10h11p10h11--


Hope it's somewhat correct!
