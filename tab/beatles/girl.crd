                 	BEATLES and Capos #1 

	I'll just post them as I feel like it.


GIRL  -  from "Rubber Soul"
	(capo on 7th fret)

      Em      Am    Em              Em7
Isn't anybody going to listen to my story,
Am                               G -->  B-7
All about the girl who came to stay.
          Em               Am              Em        Em7
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Am                              Em
Still you don't regret a single day.


CHORUS:
    G       Em      Am      D       G      Em     Am     D
Ah, girl----irl.                    Girl---irl


When I think of all the times I tried so hard to leave her
She would turn to me and start to cry.
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her.
After all this time I don't know why.

CHORUS

BRIDGE:
Am /    /   /   /   /   /    /    / Em   /    /       /     /
She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there
/   /    /   Am  --->  Em
You feel the fool.
Am                                       Em
And when you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood
Am               C
She's cool, ool, ool, ool.

CHORUS

When she was told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe when he's dead?

CHORUS

TAB for last riff (assuming capo on 7th fret and treating 0 as open string)

I'll probably post again tomorrow if anyone cares about this. I like the
Beatles, but not everybody does.

It's in concert C-minor, so the capo is at the eighth fret.

>CHORUS:
>    G       Em      Am      D       G      Em     Am     D
>Ah, girl----irl.                    Girl---irl

That Em should be a Bm, both times.

>BRIDGE:
>Am /    /   /   /   /   /    /    / Em   /    /       /     /
>She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there

Em should be E7 throughout the bridge.

Andrew
