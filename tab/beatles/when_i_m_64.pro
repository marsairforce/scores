I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday mornings, go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?

{soc}
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight if it's not to dear. 
We shall scrimp and save.
Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
{eoc}

Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?
