{t: Baby's in black}
{st: Lennon / McCartney}

[E]Oh dear, [B7]what can I do / [A]Baby's in black, and [B7]I'm feeling blue
tell me [E]oh, [A]what can I [E]do  [B7]
[E]She thinks of him and [E7]so she dresses in [A]black
and [A]though he'll never come [E]back [B7]she's dressed in [E]black

Oh dear, what can I do / Baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
tell me oh, what can I do
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
and though it's only a whim she thinks of him

[C#m]Oh how [F#]long will it take /[A] till she [B7]sees the mistake she has

made, dear what can I do / Baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
tell me oh, what can I do
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
and though he'll never come back she's dressed in black

Oh dear, what can I do / Baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
tell me oh, what can I do
