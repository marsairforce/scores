{title:Nobody I Know}
{subtitle:Words & Music: Lennon/McCartney}

[C]Nobody I know could [Dm7]love me [G7]more than [C]you.  [Dm7]        [G7]
[C]You can give me so much [Bb]love it se[G7]ems un[D7]true.  [G7]
[C]Listen to the bird who [Em]sings it in the tree,
[Am]and the when you've heard him, [Ab]see if you agree.
[C]Nobody I know could [Dm7]love you [G7]more than [C]me.   [Dm7]        [G7]

Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
Everyone I know is sure it shines on you.
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
suddenly it seems, I've found a paradise.
[C]Everywhere I go the [Dm7]sun comes [G7]shining th[C]rough.  [D]       [G7]        [C]


    [Am]Means so much to [E7]be a part of a [A]heart of a wonderful [C]one.
    [Am]When other lovers are [C]gone, we'll live [Dm7]on,     [G7]  we'll live [C]on.   [Dm7]          [G7]
