VERSE:
-------

G      D          C       G
In the town where I  was born

Em       Am        C         D
Lived a man  who  sailed to  sea

G       D        C      G
And he told me   of his life

Em      Am       C     D
in the land  of submarines



(Repeat same chords for all verses...)

I may make a few slip ups on the words, but please excuse me.

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine


Chorus :

G                D 
We all live in a yellow submarine

D                G

G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine

D                G

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play.....

And we lived a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue, sea of green
In our yellow submarine
