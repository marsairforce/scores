Here's the tab to one of the first songs I ever learned...

NORWEGIAN WOOD (THIS BIRD HAS FLOWN) by the Beatles

e----------------------------------------------
B----------------------------------------------
G---4--2--0--------0-----------0---------------
D------------4--2-----4--0---------------------
A---------------------------3-----2--0---------
E----------------------------------------------

That's the little melody riff that runs throughout the song.  The rhythm
in the background is like this:

e--2---2-2-2---2-2-----------------------------
B--3---3-3-3---3-3-----------------------------
G--2---2-2-2---2-2-----------------------------
D--0---0-0-0---0-0-----------------------------
A----------------------------------------------
E----------------------------------------------
   V   V ^ V   V V

V = downstroke, ^ = upstroke

You can change the chords in the rhythm from D to other chords.  I don't
remember the exact progression...it was something like:

D  Dm  G  Am  E

but I don't think that's quite right.

Well, there's my first tab posting.  I'll try to post some more as I
learn them.
