My favorite Beatles cover, and it's easy to play too.

	Baby It's You

G 6/9 chord 322233

Intro: | G 6/9 - Em | twice
       | G 6/9 then single notes G A G F#|
				(repeated at end of first line of verse,
				and at end of verse)

(listen to the record to get the right feel)

Verse changes:

	|C |C |G |G (riff)|
	|C |C |G |G |

	|Em |Em |Am |Am |
	|G  |Em |C  |D7 |
	No chord: ('cause Baby it's you)

	then repeat intro but with "sha la-la's"

outro: same as intro

1. It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
   It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart,
   Uh, Oh

   Many, many, many nights go by
   I sit alone, at home and I cry
   Over you, what can I do
   Can't help myself
   'cause baby it's you

2. You should hear what they say about you (cheat, cheat)
   They say, they say, you've never, never, never ever been true (cheat,cheat)

   Doesn't matter what they say
   I know I'm gonna love you any old way
   What can I do, when it's true
   Don't want nobody, nobody
  'cause baby it's you

3. Solo over first part

then

   Doesn't matter what they say
   I know I'm gonna love you any old way
   What can I do, when it's true
   Don't want nobody, nobody
  'cause baby it's you

outro:

   Don't leave me all alone
   Come on home
   Baby it's you (repeat until tired)

This was requested by some-one.
Since it's not a Beatles original it's not likely to be found in any
Beatles song books. Luckily for youz I figured it out myself once long ago.
(Never thought I'd get the chance to show off about it)
Bit tricky since the recording is below standard pitch.

(Hard Days Night was also requested but I'm sure lots of other people 
know that one)

Quite a cute song - not as sickening as the Sha-la-la-la-la's would seem to
indicate (I my opinion anyway) and very easy to play.


BABY IT'S YOU (as performed by the Beatles on "Please Please me")
==================================================================
(Not actually written by the Beatles.)

This is only a skeleton of the songs' main points, 
but it should be easy to figure out from this.

It is very easy to play on your own - but you may be disappointed if you try
to play along with the recording because it is a bit below standard pitch
(about 10/100 of a semi-tone by my reckoning).


Intro/outro/chorus: (with Sha-la-la-la-la's)
G     Em 


The sung sha-la-la's throughout the song can be played like this (If you want):
|-----------------|
|-----------------|
|-----------------|
|--5-7-5-4-2------|
|-----------------|
|-----------------|



C                                   G
It's not your smile that touched my heart (sha-la-la-la-la)
C                                       G
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart 

Em
Many,many - many nights go by 
Am                               G                Em
I sit along at nights I cry over you - what can I do
C            D      (no chord)
Cant help my self - cos baby it's you


C                                   G
You should hear what they say about you (cheat cheat - sha-la-la-la-la)
C                                                  G
They say they say that you've never ever ever been true
etc....


Solo (slowly)
These notes have a low down sixies/country/rock-a-billyish sound. 
Should be plucked so as to give a loud "popping" attack rather than clean notes.
I do this by picking upwards with my thumbnail. May also be possible by using
a pick side-ways rather than flat-on.

Solo (alternative)
(This is an octave above the recorded solo but sounds good too)
