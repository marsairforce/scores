I'm just learning to play the guitar, and here's a song I found that sounds
really good on an acoustic..  This is a little different from the version I
found on ftp.nevada.edu, but hey, I like it better, and besides, I think
it's right! Hehehe

Don't be daunted by scary looking chords like Gm(#7)/D.  It's really,
really easy.

Lyrics
-------------------------------------
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?
Dear Prudence greet the brand new day----.
The sun is up, the sky is blue, it's beautiful and so are you.
Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?

Dear Prudence, open up your eyes.
Dear Prudence, see the sunny skies
The wind is low, the birds will sing, that you are part of everything.
Dear Prudence, won't you open up your eyes?

Dear Prudence, let me see you smile.
Dear Prudence, like a little child.
The clouds will be a daisy chain so let me see your smile again,
Dear Prudence, won't you let me see your smile?

Look Around, round round round round ....  (2x)
Look aro---und.

The sun is up the sky is blue.... etc.
