I've gotten so much from this group, It's time I gave something back.

Here's an easy tune that I don't recall ever seeing here.
There may be a few innaccuracies so I take full blame.  Just direct your
flames to /dev/null.  I'm sure to get it then.

			Don't Pass Me by
				as performed by the Beatles
  C
I listen for your footsteps comming up the drive.
  F
I listen for your footsteps but they don't arrive.
    G
I'm waiting for your knock dear, on my old front door
        F					   C
I don't hear it. Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

I hear the clock a-tickin' on the mantle shelf.
I see the hands a-movin' but I'm by self.
I wonder where you are tonight and why I'm by myself
I don't see you.  Does it mean you don't love me anymore?

CHORUS
	C
	Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue,
	C		F
	'Cause you know darlin' I love only you.
	F	     C
	You'll never know you hurt me so.
	C
	I'd hate to see you go.
	C	      G
	Don't pass me by.
	G	      F		C
	Don't make me cry.

I'm ssorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair.
You were in a car crash and you lost your hair.
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two.
I said that's alright I'm waiting here just waiting to hear from you.

  CHORUS

{ Spoken } One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
{percussion}

Do the chorus one more time but add an extre measure (4 beats) betwen "..see
you go." and "Don't pass me by."

There's also a buncha really hip violin stuff but I can't transcribe that so
somebody else should (hint, hint).
