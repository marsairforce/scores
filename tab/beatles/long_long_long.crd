OK - here are the basics.

Use a capo on about the 5th fret.


The chords used are :

  G  F#m  Em  D  A

It goes roughly like this :

            G     F#m Em    D     G   D
It's been a long long long time


A               Em            D      A
How could I ever hurt you ...............



I'm a bit hazy on the words, but you get the idea.
There's a bit of picking in places, but it's based on these chords.


The 'other' bit goes


G      D           A   Em
So may tears I was wasting

G       D            A    Em
So many chairs I was painting

G      A
Oh !   Oh !


Then back to G F#m Em D etc


Howard
