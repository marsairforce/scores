>From memory here.  I just play this as a three chord special.  And
it sounds pretty good.  I play it in F with barre chords (the F and
C with my first finger across the 8th fret, and the Bb across the
6th fret.)  Something like...


F                        Bb      C          F
When the rain comes they run and hide their heads
     Bb       C       F
They might as well be dead
         Bb
When the rain comes
         F
When the rain comes.

When the sun shines they slip into the shade
And drink their lemonade
When the sun shines
When the sun shines

F                         Bb           F
Ra ay ay ay ay ay-a-a-a-a-ain, I don't mind.
F                         Bb                   F
Su uh uh uh uh uh-u-u-u-unshine, the weather's fine.

I can show you that when it starts to rain
Everything's the same
I can show you
I can show you
