	I believe this and a few of the other posted tabs to be in error. I'm
pretty sure this is the way it is played.


INTRO RIFF:

     D                      E/D                    G/D

VERSE:

D                E           G                   D
Oooh I need your love babe.  Guess you know it's true.
D                E           G                D
Hope you need my love babe,  just like I need you.
Bm        G         Bm        E
Hold me.  Love me.  Hold me.  Love me.
D                       E           G            D
I ain't got nothin' but love babe,  eight days a week.


BRIDGE:

A                     Bm
Eight days a week,  I lo--o--o--o--ove you.
E                    G             A
Eight days a week is not enough to show I care.


	The ending riff is the same as the intro riff.

	If someone thinks this is definitely wrong, please tell me. I can take
it. But I'm pretty sure these are the chords.
	I'll post the other corrections to the posted songs if anyone is 
interested, or if no one gives a crap, then I'll just mind my own business.
