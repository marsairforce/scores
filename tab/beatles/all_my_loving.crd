First a quick question... many years ago, I heard (and recorded) a
song off of an oldies radio station... needless to say, the tape
eventually broke, and I (nor anybody else) has been able to figure
out the name of the song/who did it... so, here are some of the
lyrics (as I remember them, as it has been years):
 
"If you want it, here it is come and get it"  (or 'I can give it'),
"You'd better hurry, 'cause it may not last" (or 'it's going fast')

And, I remember that somewhere there was a break, where they sang

"A fool and his money... sonny!"

And then broke back into the song...

Any help (and, if possible, the chords) to this song would be 
appreciated!


Now, in keeping with the idea of this group, here are the chords:

Somebody gave me this a long time ago, but it works fine.
I'll give you enough info to start, but I'll leave the 
arrangement up to you:


Note:

Dm = x00231    G7 = 320001     C = 332010    Am = 002210
F  = 133211    Bb = 113331   Dm7 = x00211   E7+ = xx0110 

(at least that's how I play them... nevertheless, the song
 sounds fine like this)


All My Loving (Lennon/McCartney)

           Dm             G7          C           Am
Close your eyes, and I'll kiss you, tomorrow I'll miss you

  F           Dm        Bb
Remember I'll always be true

         Dm        G7               C         Am
And then while I'm away, I'll write home everyday

         Dm7         G7        C
And I'll send all my loving to you

I'll pretend I am kissing the lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away, I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you

       Am     E7+            C
All my loving I will send to you

       Am      E7+             C
All my loving, darling I'll be true
