Title:			I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE 			(Beatles)

		G 
		I've just seen a face
		G
		I can't forget the time or place
		G             Em
		Where we just met 
		Em
		She's just the girl for me
		Em                                    C    C  B D Dsus D
		And I want all the world to see we've met. Hm m m m m m

		G
		Had it been another day 
		G
		I might have looked the other way
		    Em
		And I'd have never been aware 
		Em                               C      C  B  D  Dsus  G
		But as it is I'll dream of her tonight. Li di di di di di

		D                C
		Falling yes I am falling
		C             G       C        G
		And she keeps calling me back again

		G
		I have never known 
		G
		The likes of this I've been alone 
		G          Em
		And I have missed things and kept out of sight 
		Em                                     C     C  B  D  Dsus  G
		When other girls were never quite like this. Di di di di di di	

		D                G
		Falling yes I am falling
		C             G       C        G
		And she keeps calling me back again
