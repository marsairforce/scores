It's been A [G]Hard [C9]Day's [G]Night
and I've been [F]working like a [G]dog
It's been A Hard [C9]Day's [G]Night
I should be [F]sleeping like a [G]log
But when I [C]get home to you
I find the [D]things that you do will make me [G]feel [C9]al[G]right

You know I [G]work [C9]all [G]day
to get you [F]money to buy [G]things
And It's worth it just to [C9]hear you [G]say
You're gonna [F]give me ev'rything[G]
So why I [C]love to come home
'Cause when I [D]get you alone you know I'll [G]be [C9]O.[G]K.

     When I [Bm]home [Em]ev'rything seems to be al[Bm]right
     When I'm [G]home [Em]feeling you holding me [C]tight
     [D]Tight,yeah

It's been A [G]Hard [C9]Day's [G]Night
and I've been [F]working like a [G]dog

I should be [F]sleeping like a [G]log
But when I [C]get home to you
I find the [D]things that you do will make me [G]feel [C9]al[G]right
