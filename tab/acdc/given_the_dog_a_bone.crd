Someone requested this a few days ago:

here's what I got:


GIVEN THE DOG A BONE - AC/DC
--------------------

       A
She'll take you down easy
going down to her knees.
Goin' down to the Devil,
down, down at ninety degrees
She's blowing me crazy,
Till my ammunition is dry.

                    D         A                     D
Now shes using her head again,     she's using her head
                D         A
Shes using her head again.   I'm just-a

 E
Given the dog a bone. (Given the dog a bone).
Given the dog a bone. (Given the dog a bone).
Given the dog a bone. (Given the dog a bone).
Given the dog a bone. (Given the dog a bone).

Shes no Mona Lisa
No, she's no playboy star.
But she'll send you to heaven,
then explode you to Mars.

Now shes using her head again, using her head
Shes using her head again. I'm just-a
 
Given the dog a bone.......

She's got the power of union;
she only hits when its hot.
And if she likes what you're doin',
yeah, she'll give you the lot. 

etc..

I had a listen last night and I think the guitars might
be tuned down half a step (why does every body do that!?!?!)

Most of the song is riffing, I had a bit of a go and came
up with this:

      A
E-||--------------------------------------||
B-||--------------------------------------||
G-||o------------------------------------o||
D-||o---2-----4-----2-----4-----4^2-2^0--o||
A-||--0-0---0-0---0-0---0-0---0-0---0-----||
E-||--------------------------------------||

     A     D
E-|-----------------|
B-|-----------------|
G-|--------2--------|
D-|--4-2-0-0--------|
A-|--0--------------|
E-|-----------------|
   usin her head

Youll notice the header said CRD:... thats because my tab transcription
is pretty poor, so dont take it too seriously. If you work it out better
please repost. The chords are right.
