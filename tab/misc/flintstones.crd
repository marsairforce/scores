Can't help you with the lyrics, but many years ago my guitar teacher 
pointed out that the chord changes to the Flintstones song were taken 
>from "I've Got Rhythm," by Gershwin (I believe).  The same is true of 
many jazz standards.


Bb-maj7  Gmin7  Cmin7  F-dom7

Bb-maj7  Gmin7  Cmin7  F-dom7

Bb-maj7  Bbdom7 Eb-maj7 Edim

Cmin7  Fdom7  Bb-maj7  "

It goes on from there, but try singing one syllable per chord--you should 
get to "family," over the last Bb-maj7.  Yes, the chords go by pretty fast, 
but it works!
